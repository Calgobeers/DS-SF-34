There's not one reason I can think of to recommend this book. Each character is miserable and unhappy and horrible. And there are a million of them and good luck keeping them straight.

Complicated. Ok it's slow until around the middle. HOWEVER, the story . . . I began to think about it when I wasn't reading. Wondering what was going to happen next in Pagford and with Krystal Weedon, with Samantha Miles. To be honest, I have the very last section to finish (just a few pages) and I can't wait. I'm not a huge fiction reader (quick, modern day women Reads like Maria Semple's work when I do) but I have much appreciated the complicated and sophisticated story Rowling has written here.

2017-04-01,R3R0BKMS7OAYJK,retiredandlovinit,Audiobook was quite engaging,"For a long drive from AZ to IL, this audiobook kept me involved and engaged for all of its 18 hours -- not an easy feat. The reader does a fine job of differentiating all the multitudes of Ms. Rowlings' characters and her intersecting, overlapping plot lines. Many characters had unlikable traits, but all of them were believable, and the intrigue of small town and school politics and prejudice seemed all too realistic. Don't read this one looking for a happy ending; some characters do well, some do despicable things, and some die in sad and, perhaps, inevitable circumstances. I picked this audiobook because I enjoyed the Harry Potter books. I knew Ms. Rowling could tell a good story. She did not let me down with this ""more adult"" novel. Good story.",4.0
2017-04-01,RPNYL5RUL5WYT,reader78,Slow moving plot,"I bought this book several years ago and couldn't  get into it. I finally opened it back up and read it while on vacation. If I had another option, I probably would not have finished it. I really wanted to like this book. It deals with some very real issues and socioeconomic prejudices. Unfortunately, it felt like every person in this town was given a fatal flaw just so everyone could have one. In the end, I felt the purpose of the book was more about advancing a political agenda than advancing the plot. The plot was jerky and almost completely stalled at some points. I was NOT expecting Harry Potter as some other readers were, but I was expecting plot development. The book kept hinting of big secrets, and it fell flat. I'm giving it two because there were two characters (Terri and Krystal) that I felt were developed to a degree that their motivations made sense and I could feel empathy for their situations. Very disappointing.",2.0

I would not consider re-reading this novel, and I wish that Rowling had published it under a pseudonym so that it would not tempt those who love her Harry Potter series.

This book is as bad as Hubert Selby's Requiem for a Dream - it's a story about people who hate themselves, hate their lives, hate each other, and hate the world. There is no happy ending, no redemption, no climactic point at which the purpose behind the horribly miserable lives of the characters is made clear. Instead, it's page after page of sullen children, bitter parents, angry neighbors, and people who want to make everyone else as miserable as they are so they'll feel a bit better about being miserable themselves.",1.0

Every character in the book is detestable.  You will be hard pressed to really like a single one.  Sure, you may feel sorry for some, especially Robby, but you won't like a single one.  There is no redeeming ending either.  It is as if Rowling tried so hard to NOT write more Harry Potter that she overwrote and made her characters as unlikable as possible.  In the end, you will hate the characters you are supposed to like the most and also hate the characters you are supposed to hate the least.  Don't waste your time with this book if you want any of the writing and character development ""magic"" of the Potter series.  The only thing propping this book up is the name Rowling.",2.0

2017-01-15,R10LT0GO1YR4T0,Marie,I've read everything from JK Rowling and am happy I read this too,"I didn't read Harry Potter as a young child. My mom thought magic etc was of the devil so I first read the series as a 16 year old who used her license to go to the library. I was enthralled (and continue to be) by that series. I always meant to read the Casual Vaccancy when it first came out but I was worried it would disappoint me having so loved her HP series. I knew about the bad reviews and maybe that did help that I didn't have the highest sense of anticipation when I actually read the book, but I had read and enjoyed all 3 of her Robert Galbraith novels and I decided it was time to read the Casaul Vaccancy. The premise isn't the most exciting I will give you that - an empty seat on a town council - and the characters and situations sometimes are unpleasant but they are so real and the characters become so real that you start to feel as though you live in Pagford watching all the drama unfold. It somewhat reminded me of Edith Wharton novels which are complicated and sometimes do not have a clear protagonist. The thing I enjoyed about Edith Wharton (I thought of Custom of the Country) and this novel is that despite the sometimes very grim nature of the books they make you FEEL. Books won't always make you feel happy about the outcome or the character but when books make you feel some emotion towards the characters that is job well done to me because that means the characters are developed enough that they become real to the reader.",4.0

Although this book is for adults, JK Rowling is purposeful and pointed in the way that weaves lessons on compassion, empathy, mindfulness, etc. into her work. Characterization is, in my opinion, one of her strongest aspects as a writer, and it's incredible how she makes these characters so painfully human. She doesn't hold anything back in exploring their flaws, the hypocrisy that they don't even realize they are committing. Despite all of their indiscretions, their petty and at times even cruel ways, very few of them think of themselves as being a bad person, but does anyone ever really?",4.0

Hammonds,"Not a ""feel good"" read, but thought provoking.","I would love to be able to assign two ratings to this book, one for writing and one for ""enjoyment.""  So I am settling for the middle rating as an average of the two opinions.  Any who have read one or more of the Harry Potter books knows that Rowling is expert at drawing finely developed characters, setting almost tangible scenes, and bringing the reader (in my case the listener, as I ""read"" this on audio CD) up close and personal with the characters.  As the book progresses, one feels increasingly drawn into the lives of the many characters. The author skillfully interweaves their lives in the most natural of ways.  The actor who read the audio version of this book was superb ... his vocal representations of the characters were so consistent that after a relatively short time, when a character was speaking, the  narrative didn't need to tell you who it was - the actor's voice made it very clear.  So for writing skills, this book would receive 4 stars from me.",3.0

I recognized myself in far too many of the people. Beautifully illustrated how a small group of people can see/hear/experience the same thing and yet come away with vastly different impressions. It shows how easy it is to dismiss someone we find unpleasant, forgetting that there's a fully developed human in there, with experiences and motivations of which we know nothing. No character comes away unscathed by his or her choices, or indeed, by their backgrounds. It's probably too sexual for most high schools to use, but what an excellent discussion piece about assuming things about others and judging people. Also a scathing review of current social services for the 'dregs' of society. I didn't realize Rowling had a background in social work until after I read this.",5.0

The first time I read this book, I have to admit it was difficult to keep focused as you're bouncing around in the minds of different characters, but the second time I read it, I was absolutely overwhelmed with the ""big"" message she has in here about reaching out to others and what a difference we can make in each other's lives.

The pettiness and self-serving behavior of people, both in the community and even within families is evident from the start.

Rawling fan so I went into this with little to no expectations.  I found the overall story very boring.  Near the end it got better, but it almost wasn't worth finishing.  Reading this book was like running a marathon; you start out feeling really good about it, then you get so out of breath and nauseous you want to stop, but you're so close to the end, you just force yourself to finish, and then you question if it was really worth it.  I would mostly recommend this book to people who care about politics (which I do not, at all - especially English politics).  If you don't care or understand politics you're going to be lost for most of this book (like I was).

The book is good, but I wish there was more of a point, it feels like a book with potential. Could have been more, could have done more. I liked the fact that I really couldn't see where the story was going, which kept me interested. But by the end of it, it felt like there something was missing... I was waiting for a climax, which never really happens. There are a lot of characters and Ms. Rowling does a good job on developing them, but maybe there was too many people, and the story got lost.

However, instead of  the deep-set fear and anger towards the magical world that the Dursleys possess, many of the Pagford residents cast their disdain upon the people of the fields, a poor, crime-ridden area at the edge of the parish.  The parish council is divided; some members want to continue to support The Fields and others want to pass them off to neighboring Yarvil Parish.  When a seat on the Council opens up, both sides scramble to fill the seat, and much ugliness is exposed, both in The Fields and in Pagford.",2.0

I highly suspect that its average rating can partially be blamed on the fact that it isn't the world-beloved boy wizard, saving the his friends between its pages; also it is adult fiction, and a fiction that is unpleasant in just about every way. I daresay that Ms. Rowling might have done herself and the book a favor had she written her first book after graduating from Hogwarts under a pseudonym; I wonder if the reviewers consciously or unconsciously were a little extra hard on the author because they thought writing for children to be much easier than writing for adults.

I should add that while I do love the Harry Potter series, I have not read most of those books - the movies were already coming out before my kids were old enough to read.  Perhaps that is why, in part, I do not have a strong rebellion to this content as some of the Harry fans seem to be struggling against; but then again, I can recognize the difference between teen fantasy novels and present day novels for adults. Something the 1-star folks probably need to do too.  All in all probably more of a 4 or 4-1/2star than a 5 for me, but like others I feel the ratings need to be counter-balanced.",5.0

She is rich (worth about 620m, according to Sky News, though one wonders how they can know). She is massively successful as a writer and generates plenty of jealousy (another writer once accused her of sucking the air out of the market, apparently).

With The Casual Vacancy, she has, once again, proved that very few authors can touch her astounding ability at doing just that.  Brutal in its realistic depiction of a small town and those who inhabit it, Rowling draws such fine, full, searing portraits of her characters.  Though at first, those portraits seem cold and harsh, Rowling infuses her characters with deeply touching (if also infuriating and disturbing) humanness.  One gets the sense that she knows these people intimately, and loves them despite their appalling failings and cowardice.  As a reader, I was shocked and disgusted by behavior that I hope I would myself never engage in, by thoughts I hope I myself would never entertain.  By sketching these people and their failings so fully and honestly, though, Rowling forces us, though we might pass judgement on the inhabitants of Pagford and Yarvil, to confront the bits of ourselves that are familiar in these people.",5.0

I had even avoided it for years, but after reading and thoroughly enjoying the two Cormoran Strike installments, I couldn't put it off any longer.  Believe me when I say that your patience will be justly rewarded.  While reading, I was struck by how mean and narcissistic the characters were, and my ability to identify with them.

Bronte,An engrossing enjoyable read,"I admit I procrastinated in reading this book after hearing some negative reports about the crude language, the unpleasant characters, and the all around disappointment of many with this beloved author.  I should have known better.  J K Rowling just can't write a bad book.  This one is as carefully crafted as her magnificent Harry Potters, everything falls in place.  The language that some readers deplore fit the characters exactly.  I found the insight into human nature to be as finely accurate as that in the HP books, but the struggle between good and evil now takes place within the psyches of her people.  As others have stated, this book isn't for everyone.  But if you have lived in a small town like this one, it rings as clear and true as a bell.  The striving for position, for holding onto small amounts of power, the desperation of the big fish in a small pond mentality, is dead on.  J K Rowling is expert at dissecting the layers that hold such societies together, showing how fragile they are.  This is a book I am glad to have read.",5.0

The novel is pretty slow going and she lulls you into thinking, ""Ok, this is English life in a small town written like a soap opera"" but as you keep reading, you can sense that something is happening but you're not quite sure what it is.

Peyton,Almost TOO Real but I Still Recommend It,"It was a much quicker read for me than any of her Harry Potter books, but I can't say it was an enjoyable read because--unlike her fantasy novels--everything is almost too real to be enjoyed, and yet, that was probably her point. The characters' lives kept the pages turning even though their conflicts were mostly petty and often downright stupid, but it's those kinds of people who believe their issues supercede everyone else's. The lives of the downtrodden don't matter even though those people to whom the small-town and small-minded people turn up their noses have the most real problems. Like reality, their outcomes don't fare well at all. Also like reality, the harsh underbelly of racism and classism remain virtually unchanged and almost unnoticeable if it weren't for Rowling's omniscient glimpse into the ugliest minds of the most seemingly banal of characters.",4.0

I selected the book because of the author, decided to read it because of the cover jacket description and continued reading to the end because I wanted to see how it ended and I wanted to get a picture of British village life. I was not making Harry Potter comparisons at any time. I am able to compartmentalize my expectations and took this book on its own merit. That being said, it was difficult for me to make it through the book. The numerous characters were hard to keep straight until almost half way through. Once I thought I had them sorted, the story became easier to follow and I did develop feelings, good and bad, for some of the characters. I would not recommend this book except as a look into the way villagers live from day to day as they struggle to find their place in the scheme of their world. I saw another review that mentioned Peyton Place and that was my first thought on completing the book as I reviewed my reaction. That characters have few redeeming qualities and the ones they do exhibit do not seem strong enough to be a permanent part of their substance. They have moments of ethical or moral behavior but can't seem to maintain it and fall back into old habits. Almost as if the reason they behave ethically is not because it is the right thing to do but because they have considered how others will perceive their action.

I did find myself wondering who a character was shortly after the introduction.  This corrected itself as I got further in the book, but in the beginning it was slightly confusing.

The story evolves around the candidates' families/extended families and it touches the lives of a single-mother who is a drug addict and her two children - a teenage daughter and a three year old boy.

It got off to a little of a rocky start, and the large cast of characters lost me for a little while before I hit my stride. But this is one of the best depictions of human foibles, how we think we are versus how others perceive us, how we all have brutal flaws and soaring high points. The shifting perspectives allows an insight into different points of view, creating multifaceted, interesting characters. I hated and loved all of them. By about halfway through this book I was having trouble putting it down and upon finishing it was left with a powerful ache and a new perspective. This book is probably not for everyone, and I can see how many a HP fan would be disappointed and bewildered. This book is JK doing something very different. It's adult, it's serious, it's complex, and it's very heavy. The book this most reminds me of is The Goldfinch, which I recently finished. If that sort of thing isn't your cup of tea, this probably isn't either.",5.0

Smith,"Brilliant, Moving, Humorous Novel; Loved It","Knowing the brilliant imagination required to write the Harry Potter series, I knew that Rowling would make a great writer of adult novels, and I was not disappointed-quite the opposite.  This is a brilliant book which illustrates Rowling's true empathy and understanding of human nature; it illustrates without cliche what makes us all different and what makes us all similar.  Some of the rough and disadvantaged characters in the novel are probably as complete polar opposites of Rowling as could be possible in behavior and social status, but she is able to create characters whom you are simultaneously sympathetic with and repelled by.  Rowling understands people, all kinds of them; and she is not a snob...that much is clear from the book.  I could not put this book down and I truly enjoyed getting to know these characters; they are beautifully well-drawn and the book contains a lot of humor in spots which balances out some of the tragic and negative aspects of the story.

2014-07-22,R3IDW1H38574I0,Ka Riley,No Casual Writing Here!,"Causal Vacancy incites all sorts of reactions, and my friends, like the public, are severely divided on the merits of J.K. Rowling's departure from the world of wizarding magic. Unlike the Potter series, Vacancy is written for adults and deals with the kind of political wrangling we so often see in the news. The characters are all flawed, as is humanity. Some are seriously ill, mentally or physically. Some are well off; others are poor, living in deplorable conditions. Rowling's cast is varied and large; it isn't always easy to keep track of them, and most aren't likable enough for readers to form sentimental attachments to them. However, they are all rounded and real. So real, in fact, that it's easy to see them in one's mind's eye, to know they are people who might be on any street in any neighborhood.",3.0

Some hide behind a thin veneer of respectability while others don't have that luxury.  Rowling deftly weaves the threads of all the personal narratives together, using the death of one man as a touchstone; by the end, all the characters collide through a series of heartbreaking events that bring out the best or worst in each.  The book is like life itself, moments of redemption and grace mingled with painful self-realization that can bring you to your knees.

Clearly she can write and this book shows that she has some pretty great range beyond the Potterverse. I liked the butterfly effect concept that runs through it, the notion that one event triggers off a sequence that flows through the rest of the story. I thought the characters were pretty engaging for the most part although I thought a few didn't bring much to the table and some were a little one-dimensional (why did we need Maureen?  she isn't very relevant and only kind of becomes marginally significant at the end).  The whole Gavin character was a little baffling too other than she felt like we needed a character who pretty much always gets things wrong.  The one thing I did not expect from the book was that it, for me, was a gut punch throughout.  Some reviews thought this was black comedy or tragicomedy but I didn't feel like the humorous scenes balanced the drama and tragedy that runs from the first chapter on.  I did like the small town where everyone is out to ruin everyone angle.  That was an intriguing point and how all politics is local.  Some reviewer called this book 500 pages of socialist propaganda.  That just made me giggle.  I think you know what you're going to get with Rowling now that she has enough money to own the planet so didn't really get why they were so upset (assume this was all about the clinic and how the town was trying to turn its back on the Fields).",4.0

Rowling uses Third Person Omniscient (the inner thoughts of characters can surface at any moment in any scene) in order to present the dynamic life of a community in which hidden resentments and insincerity abound.  Rowling personally devotes much of her wealth and heart (through her non-profit, ""Lumos"")to the plight of neglected children, and in ""The Casual Vacancy"" she combines her narrative talent with a deep concern for children in a heartless and splintered world, especially those who have no voice.

Rowling book. Is this really the same author who wrote that series? If I were to picture the author of this book, I'd guess a middle-aged woman in a chronic state of funk, deserted by her husband and children and embittered against the world, living in a small community where she is able to pick up on all the scum floating around in her town. Surviving the book's pages is a superhuman effort only viable to convince one that this author MUST (please God) have a point in here somewhere! But no ... It is as actually as bad as it seems to be, all the way through.

There is something to be said for the strength that keeps people moving forward, the ""extraordinariness"" of real kindness, the difficulty in doing good, or understanding one's own motives.  There is something about the danger of lives not examined and the illusions and delusions that keep us alive.

This is the first book I have ever written a review on and I've read a lot over 60 years! I am just amazed at how the same person who wrote the magical Harry Potter books could have also written this.

There were too many characters, some with nicknames,which confused things  even more.  I thought she tried to include too manythings in the bookso it was too long as well.  We did have a great discussion at our monthly book club meeting.  We all agreed about the rating of the book, but the discussion was great. It was the best part of the book.

Even those seemingly worthy of some sort of sympathy are so flawed otherwise that they too dissolve into the waves of selfishness, deceit, paranoia, and pain that flood these pages. Now ... if the reader can handle page after page, chapter after chapter of such despair, rest assured the ride will be a worthy one, as the writing is brilliant and the many intertwined stories so compelling that it is hard to stop turning the pages even when the hint of absolute revulsion lies immediately beyond.This book is disturbing, depressing, vulgar (excessively, I thought, hence a loss of a star), and ultimately offers a less than fulfilling denouement (hence the loss of a second star), but it proves that J.K.

Everyone else is selfish, evil, abused, timid, intimidated, miserable, defeated, arrogant, judgmental, abusive or powerless.

Well, none of those here, though it could be argued that Obbo and Fats are villains (small v) and that Krystal Weedon is an antihero of sorts. But none of that clean and artificial character delineation we so often see in books. Some characters are thoroughly detestable (Shirley, I'm lookin' at you), and a lot of characters are deeply flawed (including the aforementioned Krystal), but what makes them interesting is that they ring true. The garden variety Good and Evil characters of other books are relentlessly artificial, and I find it difficult to engage with such characters. J. K.

A dear friend, who had just unexpectedly lost his wife, recommended the book.  As I read I marveled that he could get through such a dark and complicated tale and that he raved about it.

My biggest issue with The Casual Vacancy is that there isnt so much as a thin plot, but more like no plot.  The novel starts off with Barry Fairbrother dying in his small town in England, and the rest of the novel is people reacting to it.  It is full of people with petty concerns and unimportant things that they dwell on, but there is no actual story here.  Furthermore, there is not a single likeable character.  I have no idea who is supposed to be the protagonist or antagonist, but I didnt care in the least for any of them.  This novel was so painful to read that I had to stop midway through.  Normally, I stick with a novel to the end even if Im not enjoying it, but this was so dull and uninteresting that the thought of reading another 300 pages worth of it depressed me.

It was unnecessarily crass, the plot had no driving or compelling tension (so the character development just seemed to languish on and on), and the end had no redeeming value.  I'm sure that some will say that she wrote it to build awareness of those less fortunate (the poor, the addicted, the mentally ill or psychologically disturbed) but if that is the case, she failed - because she never created a character that we could care about or identify with.

At first the amount of rage against the middle-class characters shocked me.  I've never seen more cruel character portrayals or more vicious humor than Rowling directs against the Mollisons, for example.  But then I began to recall what it was like to feel as helpless as Krystal Weedon and as terrified of ending up like Terri Weedon, before  I found a teacher who cared enough to help me surmount my dyslexia (thanks, Mr. Miller!) and later professors from the lower classes  who spent the time with me I needed to learn to solve problem with words. Rowling is cruel to the cruel and speaks for those who can't write books.  She deeply explores what the loss of Barry Fairbrother, who thought everyone was at least as valuable as he was, does to a community of smug, selfish, judgmental, over-privileged creeps.  And it's balm for the soul of everyone who has ever had to contend with similar communities.  If you feel sick with anger when you see the top 10% pinching up their faces in distaste as they step over the homeless lying in the street on their way into boutiques and expensive cafes, then you'll enjoy this cathartic novel.

The other problem was that it seemed to have a few too many characters; I kept mixing a few of them up together. In retrospect, that may have been deliberate; the ones that confused me most were Shirley and Maureen, the wife and business partner respectively of Howard, the top guy in Pagford.

2014-02-26,RBGQV1EN8XHZ1,Michelle Boytim,A gritty tale of suburban English life,"(3.5 stars) This a gritty tale of village and suburban life in England. Conflicts that have been simmering under the surface for years come to a head with the unexpected death of a councilman, leading to a ""casual vacancy"" on the council. The factions on the council are divided over the perceived drain on resources by the subsidized housing community (the Fields) just outside of the town. Whereas Barry, the deceased man, rose from poverty in the Fields to a comfortable middle class experience, others are convinced that is a blight on their community. At the center of the story is Krystal, a kind of anti-heroine, a teenager trying to take care of her toddler brother and her in and out of rehab for heroin mother. She had been taken under Barry's wing as a member of the rowing team. While far from an angel, Krystal has a tragic air of trying to do the right thing but failing despite her good intentions. As the politics become nastier, we see how the families are affected and how small things can erupt into terrible consequences. While I agree with some of the other reviewers that the dark and gritty nature of the novel can sometimes be over the top and is certainly a big departure from the Harry Potter series, it is a shot of reality, and you can see Rowling's depth of character development and storytelling in spite of the modern and ""real"" tone.

No one confronting the truth except for Krystal and even then, she could not face up to her responsibilities as a sister - perhaps too much had been placed upon her shoulders too soon.

I get it that it's a trend these days for authors to write each new book in a different style, but I must ask, Why? This might have made it as a short story. The writing is blocky, trudging, decidedly pedestrian. Every now and then there is a funny moment, a witty observation, an incisive scene, as when the social worker tries to interview the junkie mother with the hungry toddler running around in wet diapers, risking his life as he fights the already entrenched negligence.

This book is the polar opposite of scope, taking cues from the Jane Austen school of thought that all you need for a good story is a few families in a small town and a spark. Unfortunately, the citizens of Pagford are never as interesting or sympathy-inducing as Austen's characters. Mostly, they are ordinary small town people who peck and gossip, desperately trying to hide their own flaws and secrets while exposing those of their neighbors.

It was a little slow going at first because she has to take time to introduce the many different characters, but once it started moving I couldn't put it down. This book is brilliant in it's depiction of human nature, including the ugly side of it. But for Harry Potter fans, I warn you, this is not at all a fantasy and is not the feel good novel that her Harry Potter series often was. Instead this book is a work of literary fiction that exposes the petty behavior and apathy of a small town, full of fairly affluent middle class people, towards a community of impoverished people on their border. Rowling has created a story that most people could see unfolding everyday outside their own doors, if only they would stop and really look. Her characters are totally believable, but not necessarily likable (though there are a few that I liked). These are flawed people, but they have their moments of revelation and introspection that lead a few to rethink their way of living.

While others complained about its gloominess and the lack of magic, fantasy and or how boring it is, I disagree. It isn't by any means a ""happy"" story, but just like in the HP series, I laughed, cried, got angry, and felt a kinship with many of the characters. HP was successful not only for its subject matter but also for the skillfulness in which JK Rowling breathes life into her characters. After reading A Casual Vacancy, I have to say that while the story may not be everyone's cup of tea (as another review said, ""if you wanted something funny or magical then head to the another genre section"")  I have to give JK Rowling some props for her first stab at writing for adults. I look forward to reading whatever she comes up with next!",4.0

I would not recommend it for children because of graphic accounts of self-mutilation, suicide, pedophilia, mental illness and other ugly realities.  JK Rs narration is effortless; dry British humor emerges but is restrained. Rowling boldly strips her characters to their sullied souls and makes the reader acutely aware of her penetrating literary eye. I dont think she wrote this book on her train trips but I sense that this plot was brewing in her mind for sometime perhaps since childhood. She is a wizard at creating adolescent characters. They are painted with so much finesse that you can touch and feel their blemishes, insecurities; false sense of bravado, odd alliances and stark rebellion. There is probably a bully like Fats in any school and a silently suffering victim like Sukhvinder. There is no protagonist but one is left feeling deeply for the rough and tough, Krystal daughter of a drug-addict mother who tries hard to beat dire poverty and the odds stacked up against her but fails miserably.

Rowling shows herself to have a very good understanding of, and a great ability to communicate the effects of things like poverty, childhood trauma, addiction, and the hidden issues in everyday life. None of the characters in this book are purely good or evil. If you want a book about good guys and bad guys this is not for you. This books takes a deep look into the private lives of many individuals in a community and how they interact. As with real humans, the characters have good and bad sides and they all have reasons for being as they are. I love that this book develops and shares the complicated lives of many characters (similar in my opinion to '100 Years of Solitude' or 'Circus in Winter'). This is not a happy tale, mind you.

This cannot be, so everybody is unhappy with conditions. One of the governing council of the village dies, setting up covert warfare for the future of the village.

Maybe this is what ""reality"" is supposed to be like in a small town environment, but it certainly doesn't make for good reading.

2014-01-02,RYFCAOOSB7Q0J,R S,"It's not Harry Potter, which is a good thing","After getting this book as a gift for Christmas 2012 and procrastinating on reading it, I finally finished it last night after slowly reading it during a period of a few months. The immediate revelation is that this book is not Harry Potter 8, it's not fantasy or teen fiction, it's harrowing literary fiction that delves deep into human nature, and through a cast of diverse and intelligently-constructed characters, shows how all of us can be led to resent our fellow humans. The plot is somewhat threadbare, which is fine; it develops in much the same way a season of Mad Men does, with the bulk of the material exploring and developing the characters and showing us the facets of their personalities, before presenting two satisfying climaxes near the end where, finally, the stakes are raised for these characters and we glimpse them in their most vulnerable states. The characters in the book are very strong; Fats, Gaia, Suhkvinder, and Andrew have replaced the main trio from Harry Potter as my favorite Rowling teenage characters. Reading their subplots makes me wish that Harry Potter had had more swearing and sex, because Rowling masterfully portrays these adolescents without resorting to hyperbole or cliche, and it would've been awesome to see a Rated R conversation between Harry and Draco or Ron and Hermione instead of the PG talk of the Harry Potter series. If there's a weak link in the cast, it's the character of the Weedons. I won't spoil their placement in the society of Pagford, but after 400 pages it was slightly tiresome to keep coming back to them in the exact same position that they'd always been in when I was more interested in the development of the rest of the characters. However, the Weedons feature heavily in the finale and this makes up for it somewhat. The book is well-written, will make you exercise the dictionary function on your Kindle unless your vocabulary is much stronger than mine, and will alternatively make you bust up laughing with Rowling's dry, dark sense of humor, and cry for the characters, not with artificial tragedy (of which there's a little bit in this book) but because Rowling makes them so achingly human that you can't help sympathize yet be annoyed by them at the same time.

I was hoping for something a bit more challenging considering how imaginative and intelligent her former series was.  I guess genius like that cannot be duplicated.

The book deals with a reality that we try to facade with the perfect home, fancy clothes and the perception of having it all together in public.

I fall into the positive camp - this was a book I read quickly and enjoyed quite a bit.  It reminded me, in a way, of Richard Russo's books in the way it takes a town and examines it and its inhabitants closely, never really feeling the need to desire to stray from the town's borders.  Everything, and everyone, the book needs is within the town's reach.  The book touches on lots of issues, some pretty and some not - poverty, disease, snobbery, politics, education to name a few.  It also takes a deep dive into a number of the characters' lives and examines the realities of every day life:  a man frozen by his fears, a woman held captive to her bad taste in men and her constant belief that she'll get her fairy-tale ending, an essentially good kid destroyed by the poverty and lack of guidance surrounding her, parents utterly unaware of the life their children lead, petty people effecting small cruelties that their small lives permit them.  It also beautifully illustrates how fundamentally one person can touch so many lives and cause a town to literally unravel when he passes away.  This is the stuff of life, and sometimes it is ugly, and petty - and sometimes beautiful and soaring.  We get to go along for the ride as people get sick and heal, succeed and fail, rise and fall.  By the end of the book, I really cared about some of the characters - and really disliked others for their smallness and cruelty.  But the fact that I cared (good or bad) shows the skill that Rowling brings to this book.  For only a gifted author can leave us caring so much, right?",5.0
2013-12-20,R1WBT0N6P80WTG,zagain,The Casual Vacancy,"In the Casual Vacancy, Rowling turns her attention away from the wizard world of Harry Potter to the more adult focused small community of Pagford  where everyone knows everyone else.  The community is in the midst of a small civil war among its elected representatives as lines have been drawn between two sides who are debating whether or not the town should rid itself of the responsibility of a local housing project (called The Fields) and a connected drug treatment facility.  Readers of the Potter series will recognize Rowling's writing style in which she does an excellent job of handling multiple characters and weaving together several subplots in to the main direction of the novel.  Interestingly, there are some other parallels to her earlier work.  Like the Potter series which focused on a central dynamic figure, Harry, who the others rallied around, The Casual Vacancy has its own central player in Barry Fairbrother, the primary leader of the pro-Fields movement and an integral player in the lives of all the primary characters.  In an interesting twist, however (which is far from a spoiler), Barry dies suddenly in the first few pages of the novel, leaving the other characters to adapt and struggle with his absence.  While Barry departs the book early, his presence remains felt throughout the plot.  The elements of the book at times seem reminiscent of a soap opera with the various intrigues of the characters, however, it is an engaging story that is helped along by Rowling's solid style.  Overall, a good novel that falls a bit short of her previous (and astoundingly popular) works.",3.0

I really enjoyed it.  I found it very thought provoking and real.  It is a look into the lives of several families who are affected by the death of a prominent counsel member.  J. K. Rowling created well rounded characters and intertwined them beautifully.  Sometimes I thought the book was funny, sometimes it was sad, sometimes confusing, shocking, and while some reviewers felt that the end was predictable, I did not see it coming.  I enjoyed seeing the characters evolve, even though it took them, especially the adults, to the END of the book to make positive changes.  I found the story line very real and dealing with issues that are happening in todays world.  I read that many of the reviewers found it too dark and depressing, and felt that J. K.

It was an amazing story of a whole town and instead of learning about just one person you got to learn about all the different people who made the town and how it came together. Yes it was sad, but it looked at the town in a whole new perspective. In the beginning of the book J.K Rowling introduces a lot of different people, but that isn't any different from Agatha Christie, and Joyce Carol Oates. They both introduce a lot of people in their novels as well, and it does make it hard to get everyone straight at first.

For me, all of the characters felt real in their own way, although at times they could border on caricature. Each of the characters (and there are many of them) saw the world in a slightly different way and responded to the world in a different way.

There are several really good scenes, and there is a kind of resolution at the end, if in the midst of great sadness. Some of the characters seem to find something like ""salvation"". And a couple unpleasant and unredeemed characters at least get a good lesson, and hopefully will learn something. Still, the ending does not tie everything up neatly; it is more realistic than that.

Barry Fairbrother is the character who dies at the very beginning, setting off the events of the book. And yet...Rowling makes you care about him, a character you barely meet. She makes you care about all of the inhabitants of the town, and makes you see the motivations and passions driving all of them - there is no objective right or wrong in this little world of Pagford, no true good or evil.

Three quarters of the book is background, with all the ""action"" coming at the very end.  Most people would find this book boring unless they are interested in personality studies, particularly character defects. None of the characters are likeable or truly happy. One of the takeaways from this book is the drawbacks of living in a small town. Another point seems to be that we never really know the innermost thoughts of another person, even our spouse or immediate family members. And, if we did, we probably wouldn't like them.  The book makes you question whether anyone is really nice deep down. The book is very thought-provoking about the human condition if you can get through it all, but one is left depressed.",4.0

There are no killings, the plot revolves around a death on the first page and the implications it has on the lives of everyone in the country village and the ""Estate"", by creating a Casual Vacancy. I did not give it five stars because it plods along to a fairly expected end with hardly any real surprises or plot twists. It doesn't compare with the Roger Galbraith crime novel.

The end does not end on a sad or happy note but a mix of both. The only complaints I have with this book is that it does not make an impression that will last for years.

Rowling takes a long time (the first half of the book) setting the stage for the action that comes in the second half.  But, having now read the entire book, the first half is justified.  At its core, I think that The Casual Vacancy is a character study.  Rowling is delving deep into the human heart and the human condition.  She doesn't paint a rosy picture of humanity (she didn't in Harry Potter, either, by the way).  Instead, she is candid in revealing a portion of humanity as it is: fallen, flawed, often limited by circumstance, and self-centered.  Rowling takes the time necessary to explain and examine the human beings she portrays.  These character examinations make up much of the first half of the book.  I think the difficulty in starting this book and staying with it is the lack of focus on plot in the first half of the book.  In the end, that's a great thing.",5.0

2013-09-07,R1B2FG4NE6T02B,SS,The greatest mistake of J.K.Rowling,"By having the 2nd ever sold book (HP series) in terms of quantity in the history of the humankind, Rowling created a brand for her name, possibly one of the strongest brands in the world and definitelly in the literature field. Million army of fans was ready to buy Hogwarts library books, the tales of beedle the bard, and the foresaken Harry Potter encyclopedia that will never appear, unfortunately. So what does she do? She destroys that brand by going in completely different niche. From childish, teen type of a book that actually suited perfectly even adults into some dirty and nasty book that made me vomit. It is like, if Maybach started to produce Smart type of cars from tomorrow. Totally illogical, nonsense. Who is she now? What can we expect from her? Another adult book that depicts the ugly parts of our lives? Instead of being number one in the teen niche of the book shops, she digged a grave for her name and her brand. It does not matter whether you liked or not the book so much. It matters that Rowling moved into another direction. It is up to you to like it or not. However, it is utterly disappointing that the possibility of seeing HP like books is vanishing year by year. And who else, if not Rowling, could give us those magical hours of reading and rereading the book?  Excuse me, but there are thousand of writers in the same adult genre and if I want something more realistic and criminalistic, I will 100% find a good book in the nearest book shop. But WILL YOU FIND A GOOD book for your children that will keep them away from computer? I doubt that.",1.0

2013-08-28,R2DWC2DAZPZEDY,Charles W. Brice,Worth the Effort,"A Casual Vacancy is structured like a Victorian novel: many characters written in the omniscient point of view so that the author can slip in and out of the minds of each character. The book is complex and multilayerd. JKR begins with the death of Barry Fairbrother, a councilman in the small down of Pagford. His death causes ripples to move through the cauldron of pettiness that is Pagford revealing the truth behind the facades of many of the most prominent members of the community. This book comes the closest of any I've read in years of replicating the experience of being a psychotherapist, of learning what most lives are really about behind their appearances. JKR's psychological acumen is outstanding, especially when portraying the dynamics between prominent hypocritical parents and their mostly dramatically disturbed offspring. In the character of Simon Price, she presents the best depiction of a malignant narcissist I've ever read. The first 60-80 pages are difficult because the author presents many characters (reminiscent of Richard Russo) and the reader must work to keep them straight, but the labor involved is more than richly rewarded. I'm afraid that the books mixed reviews are coming from reviewers (even from some of our most prominent newspapers) who simply don't want to spend the time on complex novels that can't be speed read. God knows what these reviewers would have done with Dostoevsky or Tolstoy. They certainly lose patience with other brilliant authors - Murakami, for instance. Anyway, A Casual Vacancy is a brilliant novel, worthy of the woman who created the Potter series.",5.0

The transitions were natural and made reading comfortable. That being said, I felt the book had a very slow start. I was disappointed when I reached the halfway point and we were still talking about the same man's death. Then we jump forward to the end and everything happens all at once. The events naturally needed to happen to end the story, I just wish they were spread out a little, I felt like I was being rushed out of the story by the end of it. It also seemed as though JK has lined the ending up to make a sequel, which bugged me a little with the open ended-ness of the different characters' happenings.

2013-08-17,R1ZB480O3OE69S,Cloggie Downunder,a brilliant read.,"The Casual Vacancy is the first adult novel by popular British author, J.K.Rowling. This contemporary fiction is set in the seemingly idyllic English village of Pagford, where the sudden death of Parish Councillor, Barry Fairbrother creates a casual vacancy on the parish council. As subsequent events are narrated from the points of view of various different characters, the picture emerges of a village whose inhabitants are not all satisfied with their lot in life, a village of simmering tensions waiting to boil over. Rowling's characters are easily recognisable as the denizens of the typical English village, but at the same time, show individual depth and appeal (or repugnance, as the case may be). And it seems quite a few of the characters have a secret (or two). The setting, characters and events will resonate with readers, and these same happenings drive the characters to desperate actions that ultimately result in tragedy for some. Rowling manages to pack quite a lot into this novel: she has an obese megalomaniac, drug addicts, computer-savvy teens, a fawning wife, a violent husband and father, an anxious teacher, and a caring social worker, to name just a few. There is domestic violence, rape, racism, corruption, self-mutilation, bullying, gossip, teen pregnancy, child abuse and SQL injection. But if this sounds depressing, it is relieved by the underlying black humour that fills the novel.  This all comes together to make a brilliant read.",5.0
2013-08-16,R2RQO42URS4DO7,A. Barree,Anthony Trollop redux,"In the tradition of Anthony Trollope, Rowlings develops a seemingly simple situation in small town goverment into a full blown drama.  The story evolves from the various characters' reactions to the sudden death of Barry Fairweather, a man who provided support and stabilzation for many of his fellow citizens. As the story unfolds, these individuals' backgrounds and feelings are revealed.  While some unravel to the point of crash and burn, there are those whose dignity is preserved or restored. I particularly enjoyed the author's technique of revealing, largely through internal monologue, the inner lives and feelings of not only the adults but the adolescents of the town.",4.0

2013-08-13,R11TH6MNPB7RA9,lin,Trust J K Rowling to build depth. Keep reading. It will stick with you.,"If I hadn't trusted what an incredible author J K Rowling is, I would have tossed the book. She seemed to have dispensed with her skill to engage the reader into a main character, but trust me, she pulls it off in a most backdoor fashion. The characters are flawed, human, and eventually... vivid. Only well into the book, do we get the insights and compassion we have seen in good ole Harry & company. It's a side of life we don't usually seek out for casual escapist reading. Nearly half the book is spent in giving us the seamy side of her characters before she lifts the veil and we see beneath the sheen of their delusions of themselves. In the end, they recover some deeper introspection to their attempts to appear perfect. This is not a perfect world. It is a world of ""work in progress"" and a messy business it is. I find myself assessing how giving and caring I've been and will become, as this book distills itself in the trickle down aftermath of reading. It's a tough read and poignant to the point of painful, but Rowling always takes the higher ground, bringing depths to the most vile, uncovering the twists of fate that created the Snapes and Vordemorts. Even our beloved Dumledore emerged with flaws. In ""Casual Vacancy"" we come to know the deceased Barry Fairbrother through his profound influence on others' lives. She shows us that we are all capable of more... more depth... more compassion... more humanity... more beingness... and gives us this excruciating set of examples of what not to be and do, and then, what we could... if we dared... BE.",4.0

Only one or two adults do you have any sympathy for in the entire book (and one of them dies at the beginning). The rest of the adult population seem to be line drawings of what is wrong with humanity --- delusional expectations, overwhelming desires to escape from reality, self-righteousness, narcissism, corruption, drug addiction, me-me-me-me. It just doesn't strike true that an entire book could be made up of such a sorry lot of humanity. The kids do come off slightly better and are definitely given a range of emotions, struggles and shades of depth. However, again, the person you are holding out hope for also dies.

However, there is no suspense or mystery--when anonymous things occur, she tells you who is doing them as they happen. There are no likeable characters, just unhappy parents, unhappy teenagers, and a lot of bad results.

Kept picking it up and reading a few more pages but ultimately, I felt like JK took the first few chapters of HP and embellished upon them to create this. It's like reading about Vernon Dursley and the drivel that is his life. I understand that some people enjoy this as a character study and maybe if I was so invested in the miserable lives of the lowest of society, this would have been fascinating but I don't take time out of my day to get depressed by the sadness of characters in a book. I don't feel that there is a clear protagonist and antagonist in this book so it makes it hard to grasp on to anything going on or to even care for this collection of people. Just really depressing and sad. Better to escape to a world of hope.",2.0

It takes a while to get into, since there are more than a dozen main characters and you have to get to know them well enough to tell them all apart. Once that is accomplished, you can sit back and enjoy the wealth of social issues Rowling addresses. The characters are realistic and relatable, and though the overall feel of the book is one of pessimism of negativity, it has its moments of warmth.",4.0

Not everything is wizards and roses.  What I liked about it is that each of the main characters seemed to have equal time in the book.  They all had something to add to the story, and being that this takes place in a small town, I find it very true to heart.

To add to this is the fact that this story is taking place in England and the idiosyncrasies of the British dialogue and mannerisms isn't charming it is also boring. I can imagine getting back into it.  I do have to say in all honesty I have just been on a Stephen King Bender and have read several of his including, Cell, Full Dark No Stars,Fire Starter, the Dome, Joyland, Plus Dan brown's the Inferno which I can recommend  all of the above highly. I also read the Trilogy by Heitzmann the Michelli  Family, While not a Stephen thriller it was a very nice story and I wanted more so ended up reading all three.

This story of a small town and its residents is both subtle and hard-hitting.  The layers of the story begin to unfold as the sudden death of a council member, Barry Fairbrother, leaves what is called a casual vacancy on the board.  Rowling pulls no punches as she allows the reader to get to know each of her dozen or so characters.  On the surface some are drug addicts, adulterers, and over-ambitious small town politicians.  Yet, as Rawling slowly peels back the layers of the story, we begin to understand how each character came to be.  More importantly, we begin to understand the casual vacancy created by Fairbrother was not only on the council but also in the lives of the townspeople.",5.0

Her first venture into the adult market has proved that she can write and entertain us in the real world as well as fantasy. I am actually not sure if I would have chosen to read this novel from the blurb had it been by an unknown author, but because it was written by J.K Rowling that was a different matter. She has always claimed that she uses real people as the basis of stories and this comes across with totally believable characters in 'The Casual Vacancy' which is an interesting bird's eye look into life in a small town in the UK, sadly probably pretty near the mark when it comes to home truths about society today! I was not surprised to read that the BBC are already planning an adaptation of the novel for television, where its realistic drama will come across well.

But once I was, I couldn't put the book down - each character was developing nicely, and the plot had picked up to an interesting speed. The ending was perfect and had a semblance of happiness to it. I was so happy when all the lies and deception that surrounded the characters was pushed out in the open and they were forced to recognize it.

Unfortunately, this is so over the top as to be equivalent to Emma Watson becoming a hardcore porn star to prove that she's a big girl now. This book is so dreadfully overdone it's difficult to read. Character after character is one-dimensional and completely self-deluded. Yes, I know all humans are flawed and that we all have faults that could be put under a microscope. Rowling seems to believe that every single person is nothing but flaws utterly without redeeming characteristics. If she intended this effect, this is a terribly cynical and simplistic novel; if she instead intended to provide some positive character traits and complex personalities then she failed miserably and the book was poorly written.

The characters were plentiful and complex, and she managed to intertwine their lives with the realism and originality that is indicative of only a truly great author. It is a stunningly raw portrayal of human nature and its response to the political and social atmosphere of today. If you are looking for a happy ending or a light read, this is NOT the book for you.

If I like something someone has written, I'm fairly likely to pick up his/her next book.  So it wasn't a stretch to read a 'different' book from Rowling.  I certainly wasn't expecting it to be anything like Harry Potter in the sense that there would be magic, fantasy or separate worlds.  I did however expect magic - as in being transported into an enchanting town and mesmerized by the interweaving of the character's lives.  I was therefore disappointed because there were far too many characters and they were rather flat.  Krystal Weedon was someone I was truly pulling for because her life was so truly depressing.  She was the underdog and unfortunately, stayed that way.  Simon Price? Omgoodness I wanted so badly to see his true demise and his family get even with him.  Since I'd been very pleased with the majority of the Harry Potter books, the content, the growth of characters and their emotional register, I was disappointed by this book and the writing in general.

It's quite a departure from the fun and exciting world of Harry Potter. This story focuses on the lives of 20 or so people in a small town in England and how they are all affected by the passing of a beloved town councilman. The thing you'll notice first about the book is how much more violent and sexual it is than expected. The story starts off rather slow and may confuse some because it goes through the process of introducing us to each of the main characters. This takes up the first third of the book or so. While I was reading the first third, it didn't seem like there was much of a story to tell. The main plot doesn't really set into motion until the middle of the book, and then it becomes very interesting. The second half becomes exciting and sad, and it expands greatly on the connections between all the main characters. This makes having so many characters confusing for some, but when Rowling goes further into their lives, you will be impressed by how well thought out and well-handled the characters are. Ultimately, this isn't a book for people who need happy endings, or a book for people wanting the next Harry Potter.

The town of Yarvil has never really generated a lot love within its ranks, simply because its members would rather hate than help each other. There is no civil behavior here, especially when the future of the town is at stake and about to be settled in a by-election for a seat on the parish council, vacated by the sudden death of a popular teacher-advocate. There is a piece of land that is currently being used as the home of a popular drug rehab program, which has now come to the attention of a group who want to sell it for housing development. While the campaign heats up, all the innocence that we come to associate with backwater England disappears. There is a fair spate of nastiness in this story because its citizens don't empathize very well with the needs of its more vulnerable citizens - a generation of young druggies who are going through the rigors of rehab. To keep this novel current, Rowlings introduces the Internet as that weapon that will be used by both sides to wreck the other's chance of winning. In the end, all the political mudslinging will lead to disastrously unintended consequences. Someone who has no interest in dirty politics will lose bigtime only because she can't cope with the changes this vote will bring to her fragile life.",4.0
2013-07-17,R2EOSQUB3QH1WW,Kenneth B. Clark,Just terrible,"Let me begin by saying that I loved the Harry Potter books. I have read and re-read them many times. My wife cried when Dumbledore died. The Seven Harry books are filled with the things that make books great: character, plot, story, etc.. I wish that JK would keep writing them, I would buy them. That being said, I had high hopes for this book. (I never felt that Harry Potter was a ""children's"" book. There are many adult themes and topics, not the least of which is the death of a beloved central character, Dumbledore, and the death of many secondary beloved characters in the final book.) Sadly, this book is awful. It has no redeeming qualties. Don't waste your money. What makes this especially sad is that this is an author who has given me hours and hours of joy. I wish I had liked this book. I wanted to like this book. I hated this book! Re-read any of the HP books instead. I have not given up on JK tho. I intend to buy her latest detective novel. I hope I like it, I want to like it.",1.0
2013-07-17,RHXYDC6KWVJ96,boys mom,Disappointing,"While I knew this book was written for adults, I though JK Rowling really failed.  The story line is non existent, especially given what a great storyteller the author is.  The story is really just a loose character development with gratuitous sex, bad language and random violence thrown in, I suppose to make it ""adult"".  I repeatedly put this book down, not really caring what happened next.",1.0
2013-07-16,R18Z442UAVZ4L9,captkeano,Not very good for all the wrong reasons,"I think it's quite interesting that the general critical consensus about Rowling's _The Casual Vacancy_ is that it's not fun. I quite disagree, there were parts of the book I very much enjoyed reading. It is because of this I call it ""OK"" rather than saying I outright disliked it. The problems inherent to the story are that it's just not very well written. I adored the Harry Potter books and thought that it was marvelous to have the chance to watch a writer grow in confidence over the course of a series--the books went from being relatively awkwardly paced but wonderfully imagined (the first), to confident, detailed, gripping, well-plotted texts. None of this confidence is on display in this novel. Full of point of view lapses that may be failed attempts to move the story cinematically but end up making the writing seem a touch amateurish, the story is ponderous, riddled with holes, and leaves a lot of the more powerful ideas it sets up early on unresolved or unexplored before ending predictably, leaving the reader lost as to the intent of the tale. As the novel unfolds, it becomes more of an understated soap opera than a piece of literary fiction. It's unfortunate, as the book starts wonderfully, creating a vividly painted imagery of the town the book is set up to study, but then relies on cliched character and setting work that, in the end, tells more of a non-story than that fascinating one it promised from the start.",3.0

My only complaint is that the beginning was a little slow, but as it unfolded and I realized how detestable the majority of the characters are, I still found them intriguing.  That alone should be a turn off for anyone looking for something as light and fun as Harry.  With this book she delves into a place that simply makes people uncomfortable and for that I applaud her.  Where Harry was fantasy, The Casual Vacancy is hyper-real.  Truth of the matter is that people do live in crippling poverty.  People are addicted to drugs.  This is the world we live in and it's a heartbreaking portrayal of neglect, dysfunction and how ugly human beings can actually be.",5.0

I knew it was an adult book and not intended for children but it is as though Ms Rowling set out to prove that in spite of her previous wonderful books she can write one that is as depressed and depressing as she is.  The book is a bloodbath of death, dark events, the foulest of language (how can a WOMAN so casually and frequently use a nasty word that denigrates all women???). There is not one happy person or one happy event in it and it rapidly sucks all the joy out of the reader. Most of the characters die, including an innocent child. It is not just gritty, but grimy. All the characters hate one another, cheat on one another, kill or want to kill one another, and there is no humor or lightness of tone anywhere in it.  I'm glad I only rented the CD set and didn't give her very much of my money for producing this kind of writing.  I knew it was an adult book but I wasn't prepared for it to be an expression of Ms. Rowling's ongoing clinical depression.  Good literature raises one up and inspires one to greatness; it doesn't drag one down into mud and guts and misery like this book.  Skip it altogether until she writes a decent one, and read one of the pieces of great literature that explore the development of GOOD character and have exciting, rewarding plots, like ""Shane"" or ""Rebecca"". Neither of these have happy endings, but they are well written, well plotted, and well developed. I'm not a prude and I'm not hung up on political correctness, but how can we condemn Paul Dean for using the N-word decades ago and not condemn  J K Rowling for currently using - PUBLISHING, even - the C-word repeatedly in this horrible, awful, depressing, joyless book???",1.0

Almost, I feel as if I'm reading about what happens to the Dursley's after they leave Privet Drive. The characters are all variations on Harry Potter's Aunt and Uncle, with their failings, mean spirited personalities, and foibles. I wanted one character to root for, but sadly, that one person created the casual vacancy and is missing for most of the book. This is not to say Ms. Rowling's failed. I believe she succeeded in her intention--bringing to light a serious problem in her native England. Much the way I recognize the brilliance of Schindler's List, but did not enjoy it, The Casual Vacancy leaves me hollow. Is it good? Yes. But I can't bring myself to say I liked it.",4.0

Rowling was always a great storyteller, but with this novel she proves herself to be a writer of rare insight and talent. Managing to avoid what in other hands could have been reduced to a soap opera, the best-selling author in the world delivers up a genuinely interesting and at times quite powerful take on a socio-political war that flares up within a West Country village where the abrupt death of a loved/needed/resented leftist council member suddenly throws a once delicately prevailing balance into the heart of a whirlwind. Exploring as she does every facet of middle and lower class society, Rowling somehow pays homage to the grand Victorian epics, but does so without losing touch with exactly what motivates various groups of people in a particular era: in this case post-New Labor Britain. Filled with memorable characters, some of whom are downright nasty and others incredibly tragic, The Casual Vacancy is as intelligently composed as it is addictively readable, and deserves the five stars I am giving it.",5.0

I saw a lot of my younger self in Andrew Price and enjoyed the sinister dynamic among the citizens of Pagford and Yarvil.

Wolcott,The Casual Vacancy,"I listened to this book as a book on CD, so I may have some names misspelled, but I felt it was one of the best fiction books I have encountered in many years.  It is not Harry Potter (It is not even close to it, but is a whole different type of book) , but the plot, character studies, and the interactions of the people involved in it are as good or better than what you find in Jane Austen or Charles Dickens.  JK Rowling has done a superb job of looking below the pretty, peaceful surface of the village of Pagford, and has shown it is really a seething cauldron of interacting characters, who attack, take advantage of, and support one another in a variety of ways.  And, the touch at the end, where Howard Mollison's favorite song ""The Green, Green, Grass of Home"" in which a man awakes to find his homecoming to his lovely old home town was nothing but a dream, and the reality is that this is the last morning of his life on death row, is a beautifully done touch as a foreshadowing of what will happen next.  In the next 24 hours, the dreams of many of the characters are shown to be just dreams and are replaced by reality, either better or worse than their dreams.

Even by the standards of lower expectations, this book is one depressing read, confined to a claustrophobic community where there are few heroes and many villains. I admire JK Rowling's ability to create brutal circumstances for her most admirable characters; this necessarily adds drama.

Suffice it to say, this book is definitely very ""British,"" which (I believe) accounts for a few of the less-than-positive reviews. American and British humor is very different, especially when it starts to creep into the dark comedy territory. I thought the petty conflict she created to serve as a stage for her characters to come to terms with themselves and each other was brilliant.

In order to write a biting social commentary, a writer must first make us care about something or someone, and that doesn't happen here. I stopped after the first 50 pages, skipped through and read the final few pages. Unfortunately it ends as dismally as it starts. Perhaps her muse fled after Harry. Too bad she didn't stop with Harry because that series was brilliant, and she needn't have written anything else to have been remembered as a light in literature.

The character's quirks, flaws (some quite serious)and foibles rang so true to me. Who doesn't know the poor girl who married well and tries to over-compensate?  Who doesn't know someone handicapped to some extent by mental illness, and trying so hard to hide it? And how about the married women who are searching for their own identity and also for that spark they feel is missing from their lives?  The teen-agers are as confused, curious, mean-spirited and kind by turns as teen-aged children sometimes tend to be.

I had no interest in this book based on many of the reviews. Although I know Rowling is a craftsmanlike writer, H.P. was never my cup of tea. Then,  somewhere, I read that this book is about ordinary people. Having finished it today, I cannot wait for her next book. Finally a still living author who writes un-bombastic, intricately crafted, tales of how people of all classes live their daily lives. She understands children, teens, adults, the elderly. Rowling is such a marvelous student of human nature in all of its glory and shame.

I was wrong. I read about 1/3 of the book before I gave up, never having connected with any of the characters.  I really didn't care who lived and died, or if the low-rent tract of land went to this town or that.

This book is full of extremely memorable characters, some lovable, others despicable and detestable.  This is a tale of love, hatred, bigotry and redemption; there are wonderfully inventive and evocative descriptions of lusty sex; there are many laugh-out-loud moments, and also teary moments.  As with her Potter books, Rowling gives us huge amounts of detail and back story, and, as with Potter, all elements are deftly and skilfully woven together at the end so that everything makes sense.

It felt like she got to a deadline and simply stopped. Instead we are left with a deeply depressing ending with nothing learned and nothing gained by any of the central characters.

As other reviewers have mentioned, there are a LOT of characters. But you do get to know them and I found them to be very interesting. People are funny. Some reviews said how shallow the characters were, but I found them to be just the opposite. Her characters are deep and well written. If you find the characters dull, then you will not like this book. The characters are the book. The plot seems secondary - just a framework for these characters to operate in. JK Rowling tackles a lot of serious issues in this book. I've seen other reviewers list the myriad of issues to support a negative opinion - how it was unbelievable that so many heavyweight topics were squeezed into one book. Looking at it that way, I see the point. Rowling covers death, addiction, self mutilation, rape, mental illness, poverty... geeze it sure does sound like an after school special. But honestly, I never felt that way while reading the book. I thought it was engaging and interesting story written by a very talented author.

2013-04-13,R29K1TG00BBCZL,flimfrik,A great read,"I truly enjoyed and admired this book.  I needed to say that first, because it's hard to write a positive review about a novel where characters are so flawed and difficult, especially when there's nothing flashy about their story.  I understand that when the stakes seem so low (a small town council seat) people compare them to the Good and Evil stakes of the Harry Potter books and find them wanting, but as happens in dismissive reviews of many of women writers who attempt this kind of novel, that seems like such stereotypical and lazy criticism.  How people live their daily lives is where it all starts.  How people express their compassion (or not) through local politics, through family politics, through personal whims and desires -- that's the basis for where we end up as a society.  The society Rowling presents is indeed petty and unforgiving (and at many instances unforgivable) yet why is showing it on a more personal level not praiseworthy?  Rowling takes on big topics -- various kinds of familial abuse, drug addiction, bullying -- from an everyday perspective, describing even the most unlikeable characters with both charity and open eyes.  She's especially good (no surprise) at getting into the minds of her teenage subjects, and unlike the mostly black-and-white characters of the Harry Potter books, these are kids I recognize, with complex motivations.  The crimes are (mostly) small-time and the acts of heroism are baby steps, but what can I say? it all rang true for me.

This is a study of a small ecosystem that has suffered a major loss, the vacancy which then results in all sorts of personal and community changes to fix or fill this vacancy.  It is an interesting sociological and perhaps pastoral study of how one person's life and death means so much in so many ways to so many people.

The death of the apparently only nice person in town (on the first page) precipitates the dash to unethical behavior by everyone else.

This is that book, but in English.  I had to consult my chart regularly, until I hit page 250.  At that point, I finally grasped who was who and I was able to ditch the chart.  And, that is the major problem with this book -- WAY WAY WAY too many characters fighting one another, secretly in love with one another, sabotaging one another, etc. etc.  Having said this, the book is a really good, sometimes snarky, expose on class in England.  There are surprises and secrets sprinkled throughout the book, and I liked the plot development, but keeping track of everyone was really tough!!  But for the character confusion, I'd rate the book a solid 4 stars.

I greatly enjoyed this book, even though it was strange reading some of the mildly graphic descriptions and vulgar dialogue. These are not two things that normally upset me, but as a long-time Harry Potter fan, it was strange to read them from the woman who wrote the books that I grew up with.

When this book came out, I was naturally curious to see what direction Rowling had taken after the sensational success of the Potter series.  This book is very different from Potter.  Whereas every sentence in a Potter book drew you deeper into the magical world of fantasy that Rowling had intricately woven, The Casual Vacancy was a gritty and unflinching glimpse into the reality of some people's lives.  The book is slow to pick up and most of the characters are loathsome and unforgiveably self-absorbed. The only sympathetic characters are the dead Barry Fairbrother, the tragic anti-heroine Krystal and the mostly invisible wallflower Sukvinder. Living in the stiflingly idyllic hamlet of Pagford with a gaggle of contemptuous sociopaths seems a bit like torture.  In the end, I was almost happy that Fairbrother was already dead, that Krystal was finally put out of her misery and hoping that Sukvinder's newly discovered confidence leads her to get out of there as soon as she can.",3.0

Now, normally I can read a book this size in a day or so...it took me over a month to make way through this book.  It was a slow read, because it was absolutely painful to read.  I had to build myself up every time I picked it up, because it was terrible.  It is a story without a climax, and no antagonist.  It was like watching a weeks worth of the British version of Days of Our Lives, only worse.  I would find more pleasure in amputating my own leg with a rusty spoon than reading this novel.  It appears that the publisher accepted this novel based solely on JK Rowlings name being on it.  I will be much more hesitant to purchase any novel by her in the future, especially if it is another adult novel.  The worst part is, I am American and every single one of my most favorite novels were written by a British person...in the 1800's...and I still couldn't stand this book.  JK Rowling wrote the seedy side of people very well, she is an excellent writer...however, it appears she pushed this book out as not to be known as a 'one hit wonder' as it were due to Harry Potter's fame...however, she really diminished herself with this book.  Sorely disappointed.  I cannot stress enough how hard it is to make it through this story, because it is painfully dull.  Be warned, I believe a lot of people forced themselves to like this book because of its author not on its merit.

So it took me a bit of time to figure out who was who.  Once I got into it, however, I began comparing it to the classic, ""Our Town,""  which I'm sure most of us baby boomers were required to read somewhere along our educational way.  And, I must say, I enjoyed this one much more than I ever liked ""Our Town.""  It's actually a dark story, about all the nasty little undercurrents of life that no one outside the family home knows about.  People on the outside think the family is perfect, but just wait....  I also thought the second major theme of the book, who's going to throw a hat into the political ring for a vacated city council seat, is probably so close to the truth of how that really happens than most of us would like to admit.  There were times through the book that I thought, is there no one in this town even remotely happy?  But then I realized this is how life really is, the ugly and the less ugly.  The third theme of 'us vs. them, the haves vs. the have nots, probably plays out in real life very much like it does in the novel.

""The Casual Vacancy"" is hard to get into and its characters largely lack appeal, probably for the same reason: in addition to omitting sorcery, Rowling steers clear of the exceptional.

Once I did though, I found the book compelling and hard to put down. I define the mark of a good book one that leaves me thinking about it after I have finished reading it and this certainly did.

I do enjoy a well-written fantasy world, but frankly, other authors have done that aspect more deftly than Ms. Rowling did.  Her characters, however, invite deserved comparisons with Dickens' own cast of unforgettables.

I am a JK Rowling fan and have loved all the HP books. I'm also closer to JK's age than the YA audience of the HP world. So that's my perspective. I was just so happy to finally be reading a book written by JK Rowling again. I realized in reading this book that I love her writing style. She does such an excellent job at developing the characters and the story in very subtle ways. There were a lot of characters, and I found myself getting a little confused at the beginning, but that is not unusual. It happens with a lot of books, especially the really good ones. The book draws you in and gets you invested in these characters, despite the fact that none of them are very likable. That was actually what I found most surprising about this book. You have this cast of characters that all are either terrible people or woefully flawed, and you still are rooting for them and want to keep reading to see what is going to happen. I didn't want the book to end. It's one of those books that could just keep going and going, since it's not really about very much to begin with.

We peer in on a family and see how they have created their own ruts. Well, Rowling's book is like that only expanded to an entire community and a longer period of time. Her introduction of characters is brilliant (learning first from one point of view and then another). The title has its own depth as well. There is a part toward the end that was cliche and made me groan when I saw it coming, but overall it was a good read and good addition to my bookshelf.

If Ms. Rowling was attempting to write a funny send-up of society along the lines of John Mortimer or Ruth Rendell or Alexander McCall Smith, she failed. Her characters are small, mean, selfish, unattractive cardboard cutouts, so empty as to be totally lacking credibility. The story line wavers and wanders from one extreme setting to another - from the slovenly addict's hovel to the miserable high school classroom to the abusive suburban household. Much of the dialogue is an exercise in overused foul language. I forced myself to keep reading only because I was astonished at how bad it was, wondering where on earth it was all leading.

Rowling's characters are all flawed and that's okay. She works with them to expose human nature. Her character development is incredible. It's difficult to stay with as she switches from character to character, but she ties them all together at the end. The novel is very well written, although complex.",4.0

It's magic can be found in her uncanny ear for dialogue, her wonderful wit, and her mastery of the details of everyday life. She presents her characters with great satire but no malice -- even those who are rather unlikeable are treated with sympathy. The first few chapters touch on the rather mundane topic of a vacancy of the parish (i.e., town) council. I wondered how on earth she was going to sustain this premise for an entire novel. However, I became so involved in the tragi-comic lives of the characters (who are NOT difficult to keep track of) that I wished the book would go on for many more chapters. I also wished for much happier endings for the teenagers. (Despite knowing that if Crystal had lived in my town I would have judged, feared, and loathed her, halfway through the novel I was rooting for her and hoping she could turn her life around.)

This book is a journey deep into the heart of humanity, the compassion and insight Rowlings weaves through the pages is one that will open the heart and broaden the vision of any person who believes in human compassion. So many books today have two-dimensional good guy, bad guy, overtold stories to tell. In The Casual Vacancy Rowling takes us into the complexity of the human heart and through the power of the most real character development and story telling shows what a profound impact human beings can have on one another, for good, or for bad. Anyone with a heart who reads this book will walk away a bigger more conscious person than they were when the started it.

JK Rowling has a wonderful way of painting vivid pictures with her words, but after completing the book I am left with a number of disturbing pictures in my mind that I would truly rather forget (I think we know what most teenage boys are up to without reading crude, detailed descriptions of what they look at online, images that refuse to leave the mind later).  The book would have been just as effective without the most graphic descriptions.  I am not a people watcher or celebrity stalker - therefore I found the plot (following the lives of several dysfunctional families) rather disinteresting as a topic.

I recommend it to my friends who like to read and are willing to give a book a nice long try. I just wish it had been a little more tightly edited.

These people live at the lower levels of the economic and social scale and their stories are not the stuff of magic and adventure.

2013-02-13,RSRMDG9LXV0F5,Josh Mauthe,"Set aside your expectations and savor this cynical, heart-breaking, honest look at the world","It's best to put aside any preconceptions you might have about what The Casual Vacancy will be like before you read it. That's hard to do in any situation, but when the author is J.K. Rowling, author of the Harry Potter series, that's even more so; no matter what, you'll have certain expectations or ideas about what The Casual Vacancy might be like. It's to Rowling's credit, I think, that the book defies almost any expectation anyone had, delivering not a genre book, not a light-hearted book, but a cynical, dark look at modern society, politics, poverty, strained family relationships, and more. Nominally, The Casual Vacancy is about the aftermath of a death in a small English town, a death which opens up a seat on the ruling body in the town (the titular vacancy). But in reality, Rowling uses the death as a way to open up this insular world and its dramas for the reader to explore. Rowling's working with a sprawling cast of characters here, and her effortless gliding between perspectives, dialects, philosophies, and thoughts is just one of the many joys for someone like me who was curious how her prose would differ as she took on the adult world. Indeed, Rowling's prose and craft is generally superb, weaving between the past and present, sliding between characters, and juggling dozens of plot threads only to collide them at unexpected moments - it's a masterful performance from a technical perspective, and left me impressed with just how far Rowling had come from the first Potter novel so many years ago. The subject matter has been more problematic for some people, with some feeling lost in just how ferociously cynical and vicious The Casual Vacancy can be. While Rowling has created dozens of rich characters, none of them are heroes, and not one is without a flaw - sometimes, there are a multitude of them. That's led some to discount the book as being without likeable characters, which is an absurd charge to me; while there are no doubt some despicable people here, it's not hard to feel that Rowling has a surprising amount of empathy for all of them (albeit some more than others). Similarly, the subject matter here can be dark, but that's appropriate; with much of the book revolving around the town's effort to rid itself of the government housing for the poor and the drug clinic that's helping many escape their addictions, it would be absurd and offensive to minimize the suffering and difficulty that comes along with such a life. Instead, Rowling focuses beautifully on both sides, attempting to understand those who look down on the inhabitants of the projects while also attempting to be a voice for those who had no chance at anything better. If you take The Casual Vacancy as, in effect, a debut novel, you'll be deeply impressed; while there are no doubt a few missteps (for example: there's a subplot about hacking that feels a bit repetitive and a bit like a deus ex machina, and occasionally the massive cast gets a bit overwhelming and confusing), what you have here is an assured, confident step into the literary world. Rowling is taking a huge gamble here, trading her genre work in for something more literary, trading her hopefulness in for brutal realism, and focusing a lot on the many ways that human beings can find themselves lacking in empathy for even those they love. The end result is a fantastic novel, one that I read pretty much any time I had free moments, and one that hit me pretty hard as it came to its powerful climax. It's not often enough that novelists are willing to write about social classes and the conflicts between them, or the way that politics can obscure our basic humanity towards each other, and yet Rowling takes both issues on, all while spinning tales about parents and children, the way we cope with loss, and so much more. For its short length, The Casual Vacancy is an ambitious, complex novel, but it's also a very human one underneath that - and to me, that may be the most important thing.",5.0

And instead of a man being shown the difference his life had made, here the other characters see how different life turns out to be when he is no longer part of the equation in village life and politics. Unlike a Harry Potter tale, there is no hero being groomed to sacrifice himself and destroy the arch-villain, and, indeed, there is no arch-villain.

JK Rowling is AMAZING in her ability to tell a tale with interesting and unpredictable turns of plot, believable and painfully human characters, all while tackling themes of privilege, obligation and the complexities of the human heart. Beyond mere entertainment, this novel is impressive both in the scope of its ambition, and the dexterity of its execution. While it might take a good 50 pages or so to settle into its quiet rhythm (the only reason it has 4 rather than 5 stars) it is completely worth it. Do yourself a favor and read this book!",4.0

Her use of the F -word was ridiculous, throwing graphic descriptions of the teen boys fascination with porn, does not make the book an adult reading.  Many of the character names were so similar which made the reading confusing.  Additionally, the characters were ALL so negative that I ended up hating the book (there was not one redeeming character in the story). Finally, much of the writing seemed forced and some of the sentences seemed like she threw together a bunch of long words which, in the end, made no sense.

While the book is a total departure from her previous writing, it is truly a strong attempt to enter the world of real people and go beyond the obvious. Though set in a small village somewhere in England, the situations and personalities could be anywhere. The ulterior motives and the quick  and partial judgement people put on each other is a universal case. The story is so revealing in its analysis of human personalities that it leaves you with a sense of wanting to understand in your own life what drives you and everyone around you  and what is it that they are thinking beyond the obvious.

2013-02-06,R2WGN0FY8S69PI,Lydia Ingram,A masterfully written book!,"The plot revolves around an important man's death, which sets off a series of events that prove cataclysmic for all the people involved. But essentially it's about the seedy underbelly of a seemingly idyllic small town in rural England. Everyone knows each other's business, and the people are all pretty dysfunctional. The characters are all hopelessly flawed and each is struggling with untold amounts of baggage and difficulty. There are at least a dozen protagonists, yet all are intricately developed and all but a couple are extremely sympathetic. I loved it because all of the subplots are delicately interwoven, the characters are round and complex, the writing is skillful, and the harsh reality of it all was somehow immensely satisfying to lose myself in for awhile. There's some vulgarity in it, and it's probably not for everyone, but I absolutely loved it. (By the way, not that it matters, but I'm also a HUGE fan of the Harry Potter series, and while some people are strangely bothered by Rowling's venture into adult lit., I can't help but feeling that it's silly to be bothered by that - there are TONS of authors who write both adult and kid lit.

That determination came from the name on the front cover. I am extremely disappointed in my lack of praise of this novel for I had been enthusiastic about it leading up to its release. The main problem was that with the introduction of so many characters it took a long time to become engulfed in the story (perhaps a map of all the characters at the beginning or end may have helped). The use of overt sexual references felt pretentious, like Rowling was trying to distance herself intentionally from her previous audience without adding much to the story. Like Rowling is so good at, she wound the web between the characters brilliantly, but her need to prove that she is not a one-trick-pony backfired. One of my biggest disappointments is that she wasted time working on this novel when she could have brought us another classic from the world of Harry Potter. I wasn't looking for Magic in the novel, but I was expecting the Magical way in which Rowling writes. There were moments when I detected her voice, but mostly, I just was itching to finish and get to the next novel.

There are many, complex characters and a rich, deep plot that brings you right in. Like Harry Potter, the book is long. And like Harry Potter, I finished the book within just a few days. It was impossible to put down and I spent more time thinking about the book, and wishing to dissect it with someone, than any other book in recent memory.",5.0

""The Casual Vacancy"" is  a story of a small, but snobby, English village in which a village council member drops dead with an aneurysm or stroke (I can't remember which).  Of course he must be replaced as quickly as possible as not to disrupt governance.  In the ensuing days the citizens of the village show their true colors and reveal their allegiance to one ""side"" or another.  They also show their class-conscieniouness and pettishness.  To add to the mess, the neighboring village is lower-middle-class whom the uppity citizens may look down upon.  The lower class village does provide crime, drug use and addiction, and vulgar behavior.  Of course there is overlap between between the villages.  ""The Casual vacancy"" is somewhat enlightening as to the workings of the British class system.  Had the book been written in the 1950's perhaps it could be a companion to ""Peyton Place""-there are similarities; but neither would raise an eyebrow today.",3.0
2013-01-28,R3VS68Q64IC4Y0,Mesamom52,Not what I expected from a review,"I received the book for Christmas as per my request. I wanted to see how Rowling would write adult fiction, being a huge HP fan. I had read a review in the local newspaper which was positive. What I did not get from the review was the amount of profanity and sexual subject matter. I could not count the number of times the ""f"" word was used, as well as others. Even if this is the way the characters would talk in ""real life"", the omniscient author can use other words and let the reader use their own imagination. I did not need these words to understand the despair or anger the characters felt. One of the reasons I like children's fiction is that because the author can't use profanity, or perhaps uses only mild profanity, they must have a broader vocabulary to describe emotions. Liberal use of profanity I think is often used as a crutch. While appreciating the social and personal issues of the characters, I was not interested in reading about their sexual issues in explicit terms. So, I was disappointed with the book. As soon as I finished it (I did care about the fates of the characters) I took it to a second-hand book shop for resale, and gave the proceeds to charity. If you are interested in the book, I suggest checking it out of the library before purchasing it for your collection.",2.0

Without revealing the plot or going into detail for those who may want to give it a try, I can say that at first the sheer volume of foul language in this book was disappointing.  I am not a prude, and I am not overly-sensitive to bad language, and given the right situation and company, I can swear like a sailor.  However, this book is literally ""f*ing"" this and ""c*nting"" that every other sentence.  I felt like Ms. Rowling went out of her way to show the world that this was ""a book for adults"" by making the language so foul that even the most liberal-minded person would not want even their adult children with earshot of the language in this book.  Now, I realize that Ms. Rowling may have been attempting to accurately depict her characters, but I really felt the use of bad language was more than gratuitous, and that it was filler for lack of more plot or character development.  Does all of lower class England curse non-stop? My second largest problem with the book was that ALL of the characters were extremely difficult to like. Even with the more sympathetic characters, you had barely a glimmer of understanding of their point of view before you found yourself not caring about them again a moment later.  The only character that I liked was the dead guy (Not giving anything away there, as that happens in the 1st chapter.)

2013-01-22,R3B6U0185U58OG,Kim,Not sure where to begin,"After reading the HP novels, I was anticipating the next work of art by JK Rowling.  What I found is a novel that seems to be written for the sole purpose of shock value.  It is a complete departure from the writing style, symbolism, and wholesomeness of her previous works.  The only point I see in this book at all is that Rowling wants to distance herself as far away from the HP novels as possible in an effort to avoid being pigeon holed.  If that was her purpose, she has succeeded.  I found the plot's cohesiveness to be lacking.  The story has a very confusing start with introducing characters with very little connection to each other.  Over time there is some connection, but as a whole the plot and characters are not developed enough despite the staggering amount of pages in this novel.  The last couple of chapters seem to be hurriedly wrapping things up so that the book can have an ending, but the ending is in itself very lacking.  There were enough f-bombs to sink the Titanic, and the amount of time spent on pedophilia, drug addiction, rape, incest, adultery, teenage promiscuity, self-cutting, etc. don't serve much purpose in the novel.  Again I think Rowling just sat down one day and said to herself ""I bet if I write about all the crappiest things that happen in society, they will never say that all I write is children's books.""  Again if this is what she was thinking, she succeeded.  But I would have rather her goal to have been to write an awesome novel that doesn't need adult language and themes to make it sensational.",2.0

Her flair for detailed explanation did not serve her in the setting of ""The Casual Vacancy"" because the reader already knows this world and she didn't use it to her advantage in relation to character development. Rowling repeated herself over and over while trying to fill-in the characters' personalities without varying the message or delivery.

2013-01-21,R1JMDMZT6OH2IL,WON,Harry Potter and Casual Vacancy Are Connected,"Casual Vacancy is the story of the people Harry Potter was trying to escape when he went to Mugwort. You can easily turn this into a Harry Potter Prequel, for example, just by adding some budding wizardry and magic to the mix. A sort of what happened before the kids came to Mugwort. In fact, the story itself could be a Harry Potter book by just changing all the characters to magical fantasy ones. All the themes are still there, except no magic. So, when people say it's a big change I don't think so. Many of the catalysts in the plot lines are moved along by children. Life and death, good and evil, venal and carnal, petty and profound -- St. Michael stepping on evil, parental/adult power and chidren's reactions. And on and on. Instead of the fantasy characters and charicatures of the Harry Potter books, she decided go with ""reality"".

Rowling does it so beautifully. Also, every single one of her characters - and there are a lot of them - are so REAL. The ending was bittersweet, of course. But the last line makes me think that Rowling was worried about leaving the reader with too good a feeling about the future of Pagford and its residents, so she casually suggests that the congregation was unwilling to see some or other truth or something.

2013-01-20,R2TJHQLLA99X9J,French Freak,A Worthy Read,"Like so many others, I bought this just to see what on Earth JKR would come up with as an ""adult"" novel since her work for children was so incredibly inventive. As I made my way through the first two or three chapters, I was starting to feel really disappointed - there wasn't much in the way of off-the-wall creations or even action; we were just looking in on the day-to-day lives of normal (and in some cases downright dull) people. I actually put the book down for a day or two while deciding whether it was worth finishing. Not presuming to speak for anyone but myself, I have to wonder if this might be a common problem: we half expect to find ourselves reading something like a ""Harry Potter for Grown Ups"", and that is NOT what this novel is. It's almost the exact opposite of HP - where that series was all fantasy and invention, this book is a searing close-up on reality. And in the end, that's what kept me reading it. Rowling has an amazing sense of what motivates people, and a sadly accurate view of how often self-interest trumps the common good. Some reviewers have said these characters aren't likable, and I know what they mean - it's all but impossible to find someone to root for in this mess! Then again, if I'm being honest, their imperfections and shameful faults made them more relatable to me. I HOPE I'm not as morally bereft as some of the more pronounced villains who represent the extreme fringes of bad decision making, but the majority of these unlikable characters are just lost, or searching for they-aren't-sure-what, and taking wrong turns as they try to create a better life for themselves and their families. I felt sorry for them because I know how hard it can be to feel fulfilled, or how hard it can be to look yourself in the eye after at the end of the day. And that's only speaking of the individual characters - the larger storyline of the haves vs. the have-nots was equally sad, shameful,...and accurate. It didn't make me feel warm and fuzzy, but it kept my attention and made me think about myself and my responsibility to improve the world around me.",5.0

Plus, the language isn't that bad.  I mean, I don't think it's unexpected for a character with a serious drug addiction to use foul language, right?  You cannot compare this book to the Harry Potter series or expect Rowling to handle both stories the same way.  I think J.K. Rowling does a great job at weaving together a story with many different characters and subplots.  One thing Rowling does better than many authors is really make you feel like you're just as involved in the story as the characters are.  It started off a bit slow but that's not completely atypical of novels, and there are a lot of characters which takes some getting used to.  But once you do, the story picks up and really takes off.

The book takes way too much time to start to get interesting. There is way too much time spent on developing characters that, honestly, didn't need to really be developed. I found it laborious to read about the towns, and found myself wanting to finish the book just so it would be done. I can respect the detail that she put into the lives of the kids, and thought it was bold of Rowling to touch on such hard issues (especially with her fame being made on children's books), however, I don't feel that the book was as brazen as it should have (or could have) been.

When the aforementioned Barry Fairbrother dies, the seemingly idyllic town of Pagford is thrown into turmoil. There's tons of controversy over this district called ""the Fields"", full of drug addicts, which many think shouldn't be part of Pagford. Though it seems like a typical English village, Pagford is home  to some pretty nasty people.

2013-01-13,RB1XQ65MZOFB4,Steph,Worth the Read... Worth 5 Stars,"If you are looking for an uplifting novel, then this really isn't it. The characters are mostly all insecure or unlikeable or hypocrites or just plain sad, but that's what makes this novel so great. It doesn't present any one perfect character but instead a bevy of very real people who are quite imperfect. They have the faults that many of us can recognize within ourselves or acknowledge in people we know (even if we turn a blind eye to it most of the time). I felt as though I knew all of the characters so very well by the end of the book, and yes, I hated some of them, felt nothing for a few, but had a good deal of sympathy or at least understanding for the rest. You know that something bad is going to happen, but you are kept guessing who it might happen to because so many of the lives in the small village of Pagford are so messed up and teetering on the edge of disaster. What does occur by the end of the novel forces certain veils to be lifted and certain truths to be exposed, causing some of the characters to change for the better while others go on being their same (if not more) unlikeable selves. I'm quite glad I didn't let all the negative reviews keep me from this book and this amazing author.",5.0

It is dark, I'll give them that, but it shows the underbelly of society in a small town, the politics, the hatred and apathy of people and how death affects them all.  It is tragic, but at the same time eye-opening.  I could identify with several of her characters, and they were all developed wonderfully.  People who couldn't get into it or couldn't understand it are missing the point.  This isn't meant to be a happy Harry Potter book.  It's an adult novel and it's about life.  Real life.  I guess I understand the book better because I, myself, have known tragedy, and I can relate to this.  It isn't boring to me, and the people aren't completely unlikable.  They're meant to be real people, and I commend J.K. Rowling for creating such a great story.  Her talent is immeasurable.

There are/were places within characters' developments when adult care and compassion might have made a difference in outcomes; but true to life adults too are absorbed in self, the esteem of the community and keeping up with the Jones-so-to-speak.  Ultimately the tale addresses the interior impulses of developing adolescents as well as the all-to-often casual vacancy of adult role models in the sometimes cruel dramas of teen angst.

One died at the beginning and there were hints we wouldn't have liked him either if he were among the living. The other came to a dismal end. The rest of the people in the outwardly beautiful town were despicable. Harry Potter was filled with hope, the question of the nature of good and evil, and the conclusion is good is a choice and love is what makes it tick. Despite how it was marketed, there was so much more than children could possibly see. I expected even more from this book and got only misery and ugliness.",1.0
2013-01-12,R1WHVAFO6A2H5R,Juliery,Trying not to be the author of Harry Potter,"In my opinion, J.K. Rowling is a fabulous writer. She did an amazing job of bringing a town to life in this novel. However, in her effort to move on from the series ""that shall not be named"", she brought in every kind of sorrow, betrayal, profanity, and I felt very depressed by the end of the book. In fact, many of the characters situations are unresolved, as I guess real life is, but to me I felt like the author was going to extremes to stay away from what she is currently popular for. In fact, some of the teens are the same ages as the students her in other novels, but very worldly. It seems that in the whole town, not one family has a normal relationship and no one has a good parent/teen relationship.  I would not recommend this for a teenager as it would encourage some of the behaviors you wouldn't want them to have.

The dreadful way parents talk to children, the empty lives of these people, their anger and smallness, is just terribly disheartening, despite an attempt, at the end to find graciousness in the misery.  This book depicts a dreary, hopeless world, almost unrelieved throughout.  I don't think that JK Rowling's showing us all this underbelly will change anything.  I'm so tired at having this outlook shoved in front of me at every turn.  These are not pictures of reality as I live and know it; they are distressing prophesies that, with a modicum of the milk of human kindness, I personally hope and trust will never come true.  I think art, music, TV, literature and movies should climb out of the mire and show us a positive possible world.

2013-01-08,R12FD2KOSF02OU,A. Brittain,A Masterful First Attempt at An Adult Novel,"The Casual Vacancy is a fantastic book filled with realistic, rich characters, but with a few glaring flaws. From the beginning the book is a little dry, and I admit that I had to force myself through it on more than one occasion. But the reward for that is a deeper understanding of what it means to be a writer and what it means to be human. None of the characters in this book are necessarily likeable, but they are relatable. You can relate to Gavin's desire to say the things he wants, but also his inability to actually do anything about it. You can relate to the awkward sexual adolescence of Andrew, and the heart breaking dissatisfaction that Dr. Jawanda feels for Suckvinder. I've heard a lot of complaints about how dark this book is, but there was nothing portrayed in this book that I hadn't either experienced first hand or heard about growing up. Yes, the things that are spoken of in this book are horrible, but to pretend as if they don't happen is nave and unfair to Ms. Rowling as an author. It is obvious that she might have been trying a little too hard to write an adult novel, but if she had written anything less it would have been compared too closely to Harry Potter. The Casual Vacancy is a master piece in itself. Once you're introduced to the actual meat of the characters it's hard to put down, and you're left wondering how much you have in common with these people, and what that means for you. It makes you re-examine and also reaffirms what we tend to think of people. It describes a small town (much like my own) so well, that I felt like I had also grown up in Pagford. Yes, this book had a weak ending. And yes, it was a bit morbid and dark, but for her first novel since Harry Potter I was more than impressed and It has quickly become one of my favorite books.",5.0

The plot was also very slow to develop and the twists were a bit too predictable.  I did enjoy the feeling that it was written for a distinctly British audience, requiring me to look up various slang terms & brand names - it was very much like being immersed in the English lifestyle even more so than we had been with HP Wizarding World.

It seems JR Rowling may have an ax to grind against her former neighbors, who knows; Evidently, she wasn't very fond of them or her new characters in Casual Vacancy.

Well......it just wasn't Harry Potter. I understand that she probably wanted to write something different than fantasy. 100 pages in, I just couldn't find much that was redeemable about it, and quit reading.  There was barely any story line. All I could gather was that a man named Barry Fairbrother had died, leaving a seat empty on the Parish Council.  There were a few lines of description that this man was trying to do some positive work to help the people who lived in the Fields, but that was it. Was this supposed to be the story? I don't know, there was too much vulgarity hiding it if it was. If JK Rowling had actually concentrated on writing about the work he had done for the Fields people, and the gap that he left behind in improving that community when he died, this would have actually been a great story. But......NO! Instead she had to spend pages and pages writing DISTURBING and VERY graphic sex scenes, using the F word as many times as possible, and as many scenes as possible involving drug usage.  This was just gross. If she was an unknown author, it wouldn't have bothered me so much, but........she's JK Rowling. EVERYONE KNOWS THAT SHE IS CAPABLE OF WRITING MUCH BETTER THAN THIS!

It is a mistake to try and do any comparisons with her previous series. This book needs to stand on its own merit.

I pushed through to the bitter end, but the end was even worse for wear than the bulk of the volume, leading to a feeling of dissolution, despair, and failure.

The first half is almost entirely reaction, to the death of the main character.  She does a wonderful job with developing a number of different characters.

(And, I might add, she had the courage and willingness to end it after seven books instead of going on and on like some authors and ruining a perfectly good series.) So now, when she dares to write a completely different kind of book (a Muggle book about Muggles doing Muggle stuff), I don't think she's getting a fair shake because it is almost impossible to read this book without thinking of the Harry Potter books. As HP fans will quickly realize, this is nothing like the Harry Potter books. (I think my friend said it best when she said ""it's a book about the Dursleys.""

On the plus side, the characters were fully fleshed out and you could really visualize the village and it's people.  I should have been prepared, as Miss Marple had warned that a lot goes on in a village.  Unfortunately, the only character who seems to be sympathetic is the one who creates the casual vacancy with his death.  The majority of the people in the book were unpleasant in various ways.

These stories were true to many people's lives and experiences and I thought similar to other novelists, like Julia Glass, Kate Morton, Pat Conroy, and Barbara Kingsolver who talk about the ugly,complex sides of people and don't simply label them as good or evil.

It seemed a mistake at first but as I continued to read I saw the tragedy of it unfold and also the deft and fairly believable way in which J K Rowling  resolved the gap left by the casual vacancy.  I was also  concerned that all the characters still alive were quite unlovable - the hero had died at the beginning.  However by the end I could see that his work might continue if not exactly as he had planned.  Overall it is a disturbing book in many ways and I couldn't get over the feeling that the author was determined to put her stamp on writing for adults in a rather heavy handed way.  I would have liked a range of characters rather than lots of unlovable ones and a very few with some saving graces.  That said, I felt that , like many of the characters who benefited from his actions, it was a pity that Barry had died early as he had obviously started to make some unhappy lives better.  Of course Pagford is really a metaphor for society  at large.  I would recommend this book to those who like serious themes, thoughtful characterisation and well written plots.

The book provided little evidence of insight, into poverty or adolescence or any of the myriad themes she touches upon in the book.  Her characters are one-dimensional stick-figures,(an evil dealer, a clueless adolescent, a bully, a marriage-crazed divorcee, a bitter lesbian, a fat person, an ambitious person, a suffering daughter, a gossipy shopkeeper...need I go on?) and poverty is all about sex, drugs and rock-and-roll.",3.0

I Know that many fans would find distaste with such a dark work, but that is not what disappointed me. I applaud an author for escaping from his or her element when writing. It is refreshing to find new ideas and works, instead of trying to recreate a previous work due only by its success. This book, although political and witty, proved to lack depth and character to me. The characters took a long time to develop, and once they did it took far too long to establish a connection and a point.

2013-01-03,R3RUNEHDVFVGJO,Ereader,Want to be uplifted and inspired? Then don't read this book!,"I did not read a review, watch any interviews, or hear anything about this book before I read it. I simply saw it in the store, picked it up, and bought it. The book was well written and had solid characters that were well developed. It's sad, and at times quite depressing, however, I don't mind a sad book and it was offset by some subtle humor and sarcasm. Unfortunately, for every positive the book offered, there are five negatives outweighing it. I simply did not like this book. It seemed that the author was trying so hard to show she could write an adult book, that she totally over-did it. It's like the Lindsay Lohan of books. She was cute, fun, and adorable. Then she decided she wanted to show everyone she was grown up, but goes way too far, and instead of coming off as mature and adult, it comes off as childish and completely inappropriate. The book had so much vulgarity and swearing, that it was hard to read. There were a few seriously disturbing scenes included as well. I couldn't enjoy the book. I read the majority of it, but could not finish. I kept waiting for it to get good, and it never did. There was nothing uplifting about the book, and every time I finished reading a part, I was left feeling uncomfortable and vacant. If you are looking for a book that is lovable, inspirational, good-natured, or fun, this is NOT the book for you.",2.0

Rowling sure can draw you in and tell a great story. She has a way of making her characters real and human while at the same time weaving a magic web that gets you caught up in caring about what happens to them. Her use of dialect was spot-on...I could hear Krystal's voice in every line of her dialogue. The use of obscenities  and sexual situations definitely let you know that the author was distancing herself from her previous works, but at the same time they were necessary to the story line and did not feel like they were merely being used for shock value. Rowling takes a snapshot of modern life in a country town and shares with us the anger, hope, desperation, pain, fear and love that people experience and shows us once again, but differently, we are not alone. Excellent story. I hope she has more to share.",5.0

Unfortunately she made every effort to create a cast of characters that are all somewhat or very undesirable.  I cannot say that I found any attachment or desire to get to know any of the characters any better, and feel that they all have such depressing lives, that I do not want to visit their little hamlet ever again.  Maybe that is the point Rowling was trying to get across?  Still a master, but I hope her next venture finds a more endearing cast, and less foul language as it does nothing towards the story line, only creates an unecessary distraction for the reader.  Bottom line is, any book that leaves me with this strong of a reaction, good or bad deserves at least 4 out of 5 stars!  Glad I read it, glad I'm done with it!",4.0

To me it was just a paper-thin story, perhaps even a fantasy of the author that she now felt safe in committing to paper. There is too much emphasis on telling us about the multitude of characters and not enough on allowing the story to tell itself to a point where the plot disappears under the weight of the characterisations and the cloying social comment. It's that weak plot that destroys the book; the political manoeuvring to fill the casual vacancy on the council and in turn control the jurisdiction under which a particular community will find itself administered.

A true look at how the lack of knowledge of choices can affect us and the tragedy that can cause.  How grown people can read this book and not feel for the Krystal Weedon's of the world is beyond me.  I can only assume that they are ignorant of other people's reality and arrogant in their belief that they could do better if placed in the same situation.

This novel makes me think of others that are brilliantly crafted but have scenes that are so disturbing that I wish I had never read them - for example: Fall on Your Knees by Anne Marie MacDonald, A Find Balance by Rohinton Mistry, The God of Small Things by Arundati Roy.  Brilliant novels - wanted to bleach my memory after and am haunted by them occasionally.  In Casual Vacancy, I didn't like any of the characters; I felt no affinity for any of them - in fact they repelled me.  I found it all too much - too much gnarly grit.

All in all, it was very good, albeit depressing, however, it was steeped in reality.  The author excels at making you feel for the characters, some good, some bad, some downright pathetic.  The reasons I did not give it 5 stars were twofold: first, there was a point about midway through the book where it dragged a little and I started to lose interest, but it did pick up and the ending was very fast-paced.  I couldn't wait to finish it to find out what happened to the characters.

The characters in this book have been haunting me since I began reading it and I am finding it just as thrilling and exciting to re-read it.  This book is full of so very many people, deeply flawed, real people.  I have found something in common with each and every character, even the ones I didn't want to.  The book does not end well and nothing is settled but each and everyone of these characters has had their world flipped upside down and been forced to look more closely at their own lives, instead of trying to sustain themselves on the gossip of others in this small town.

It's a big departure for JKR, everything that readers associate with her - complex plot, scene setting, character growth, action, finding meaning in adversity - is not in her new novel (although the latter point is debatable).  Neither is magic, the supernatural, or tidy, happy endings. It's a social commentary on modern society, about how people interact, and about the ""authenticity"" of the folks that make up a community. It's a study of a microcosm that represents western attitudes on a macro level. It isn't whimsical, or sugar coated (the cover art of the book leads you to believe otherwise); JK actually swears which can be jarring at first, and she talks about sex (gasp).  People do ugly things to one another, think ugly thoughts, some characters are irredeemable, all are flawed.  I had mixed feelings about this book up until the first quarter of it.  The story telling is not as strong as her previous work, but her character exploration is intriguing. In the end, I found this book compelling.

The theme seems to be a rant against materialism, racism, and class warfare in the English towns and villages, and some of the details and vocabulary probably resonate best with an English reader.  To my eye, however, this is an poor-to-average effort by a talented writer - a lack of nuance and sloppy character development.

Regardless, I'm delighted that Ms. Rowling has put her excellent writing talents to work on serious adult fiction, and I hope she writes many more adult novels!

I was also disappointed in the style of the writing.  I expected to see some of the humor and charm the Harry series had, perhaps a Terry Pratchett-esque sense of humor peeking thru, but this was not to be.  I gave up  two thirds of the way thru and jumped to the end to see if the ending hinted at any reason for slogging thru the remainder of the book - it didn't.

I loved the Harry Potter series and I was ready for something more adult.  All of the skill, talent and organization from HP are missing here.  I find it ironic that she was so critical of E L James and her fluffily pornographic 50 Shades series.  While those books are not great literary masterpieces, at least you could follow the story and skip past the dull and repetitive sex passages and pick the story back up.

These are no romantic characters she has created; she allows them all the foibles of genuine people. With that comes genuine life. Anyone raised in a small community, either in England or the US, will recognize many of the people who inhabit these pages. The Casual Vacancy contains surprises that the reader is not expecting, even when foreshadowed. I haven't finished it yet, but it becomes more difficult to put down the further into it I become.",5.0

What stopped me short was the incessant profanities. This won't bother some people, and most of time I can look past a few, but by page 15 there were innumerable F-bombs, and a C-word. Ok, we get it J.K., you're not writing for kids anymore. But is it necessary to be so foul-mouthed?

The book did make me think about how we judge people because you do form certain opinions about the characters in the beginning and then you change your mind as you get to understand more about their background.

It is just the story line she created that I could not enjoy.  The main character of the book dies in the first few pages, and then you have to learn about his character through the eyes of everybody else.  None, absolutely none of her characters are likeable.

Ms. Rowling masterfully created three-dimensional characters in this book - unfortunately, a few too many. I was also impressed with the extremely-involved and intricate plot - and part of wanting to finish the book was just plain curiosity at how she tied off all of the loose ends, which she artfully managed to accomplish. It is not a happy read, although it is amusing at times. It seemed like most, if not all, of the characters frequently had downright demoralizing and demeaning interactions with each other -- and eventually this became so tiresome that I could not wait for the book to be finished.

So far it's been a pointless meandering book about mean, unhappy, ugly people with few to no redeeming qualities.  JK Rowling is good at putting words together, but a story, especially one this long, has to go somewhere.  I wouldn't want to know anyone in this book.

2012-12-23,R3I4ZMVYOS91BX,T. DeBrock,Casually Entertaining,"I'll start by saying that I have not read any of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter books, so I was not biased by her themes or writing style from the immensely popular series. I kept seeing Casual Vacancy at the bookstore and had read and heard good reviews of the novel so I gave it a whirl. The book starts out with the death of a council member, Barry Fairbrother, from a small town called Pagford in England. His death affects the entire town where he lives in both positive and negative ways. It's hard to keep all of the townspeople straight in your mind for the first few chapters, but once you delve further into the book it's fascinating to see the chain reaction Barry's death has as it impacts more and more people's lives. Harry Potter fans be warned that there are some VERY adult themes in this book, it's NOT a children's/teen's book by any stretch of the imagination and it quite morbid at times. That being said, I enjoyed reading Casual Vacancy because all of the characters were so well formed that you felt you had a real understanding of who they are and could sympathize with the struggles they go through (even if they are totally foreign to the struggles you have in your own daily life). I would recommend this book and will definitely read Ms. Rowling's next adult novel.",3.0
2012-12-23,R32RQ3OVCSEEOW,Book Smart,Disappointed,"First of all it would be hard to change genres after the success of Harry Potter. I wasn't sure what to expect after such a successful series of books that were so well-written and clean since they were aimed at a younger audience. Also I did not finish the book, I stopped after part I. Good things - some wonderful phrasing and descriptive passages; really insightful renderings of human nature. JK Rowling is so very talented and the Harry Potter books made so many youngsters into readers. It's always fun as an American to read from the British point of view, I am fascinated by the subtle cultural differences and words for things. Things that made me bail before the book was over, (which is extremely unusual for me) - all the way through part 1 I had hardly met a character who wasn't manipulative, selfish, predatory, promiscuous or abusive, to include the children. Although these characteristics are typical of the human race, you don't read a book to roll around in it, it just got to be overwhelming. There needs to be at least one character who is likable and decent enough so that the reader doesn't feel creepy stepping into their persona. Maybe the person who passed away filled this role and I didn't stick around for it, but after the last scene in part 1 I didn't have the stomach to continue. Also I agree with some of the other reviews that the characters were hard to keep straight, I had to review a couple times to figure out who was married or related to who. There were a lot of people introduced very quickly.",2.0

But when council member Barry Fairbrother, well-liked and respected, dies of a stroke in his early forties, the town is left in shock. It's also left with a plethora of candidates ready to fill his vacant seat, and that's when the fun, or the trouble, begins. Because the inhabitants of this little town, so warm and friendly to all appearances, have deep-seated resentments and agendas--rich hate poor, teenagers defy their parents, husbands and wives disagree violently, and teachers despair of ever teaching their students anything! This ia a black comedy, well-written and amusing, and if you admire J. K. Rowling of Harry Potter fame, you'll probably like this book, her first adult novel.

Her characters are alive, and I absolutely LOVED how she could write different sections of the book from different characters' personal viewpoints with such vivid insight into how they felt.

The writing is shockingly juvenile, choppy, and repetitive. It was actually surprising how poor the writing really was in a lot of places. It also just felt like Rowling was so happy to finally be able to use profanity, that she overused it, rendering it pretty much cliche. Ditto for sexual content. Both have their places in a good storyline, but sloppy overuse is just off-putting. It came across as trying too hard. The point of view within sections switched from character to character so quickly, it became impossible to know who was doing the speaking/thinking. The characters all seemed pretty one dimensional and cookie-cutter. The domineering family man who is also the town big shot. The teenager who can't stand his parents (this was overdone in multiple characters). The 'bad girl' with the heart of gold. Boy with crush. Woman unhappy in relationship. Mamma's boy. It goes on a little too long. The book never seems to figure out what it really wants to do. The plot, which is almost nonexistent, peters out way before the end of the book. We're introduced to this town and large number of its citizens, but we're never given a reason to care about them. The most dynamic character in the book is the guy who dies after the first few pages. I kept wishing this character was around because I didn't like any of the other characters. No one was sympathetic, no one was interesting, no one had any redeeming qualities (except maybe the dead man, Barry Fairbrother). A lot of the characters also did or said things that didn't seem to jive with the way the author described the characters earlier in the novel. At the end of the book, I breathed a sigh of relief that it was over, even though nothing really happened at the end. I mean, it did, but, like most everything else in the novel, the ending was rushed, unbelievable, and forced.

Having said that, I was so looking forward to what the author would do with an adult novel. She can write, no doubt about it, however why she seems to revel in these dark and disgusting characters and scenes is beyond me. Except for the poor little toddler, who is horribly abused as all the adults in his life fail him, there is no one who seems to have any redeeming qualities. The british underclass is portrayed as criminal, drug addicted, foul mouthed and lacking any compassion or ounce of responsibility. The middle class denizens of the town do not fear much better. They are portrayed as greedy, crooked, selfish, child abusing folks. I could not really enjoy this novel, because it was so dreary, OTT incidents, rape, incest, ugly characters and no bright light at the end of this long slog of a novel. Husbands disliked wifes, wifes hated husbands, and the teens are hating almost everyone who is an adult. Could the author not have found one single human being in this fictional town, that I could admire or want to care about? J.K.

2012-12-11,R1D8R8S3INYF9L,Amazon Customer,Great Read,"I really enjoyed it, but I think it's a book meant to appeal to a much smaller audience. It's not really anything like Harry Potter and very much a book for adults. There's very little plot (I'm pretty sure I could summarize the whole book in one sentence). There's not a ton of action or anything out of the ordinary. Instead this book is a character study. Rowling captures Life. It's that simple. Just life. What it means to live, what it means to have hope, to love, to feel pain, to be ashamed etc. etc. There's no need for anything ""major"" to happen because life in itself is a series of celebrations and tragedies. It's hard to like any of the characters because we see what they think, but then again, it's hard to like anyone once we get a glimpse at what they're really like. It's simply humanity: we're not perfect, no one is. And so, Rowling is brutally honest about what society is really like. She plays with the way people perceive others and even the way, people perceive themselves. This book is proof of her great writing skills because by the end, I found myself really caring for some of her characters, even with all their imperfections. And isn't that one of life's biggest challenges? Learning to love others, learning to trust people even when we know that they will eventually fail us? Not all the characters change. Not all the conflicts are resolved by the end. It's more like Rowling captured one moment, one glimpse, in the much-less-than-perfect lives of the citizens of Pagford.",4.0

Her language was so rich, and she painted such amazing word pictures in such deep hues.  She brought children's books back into the category of literature.  So it is with GREAT disappointment that after forcing myself through almost half of The Casual Vacancy, I close it and give up; I will not and cannot finish this book.  Boring, boring, BORING.  There is not one character in this book (and there are probably too many to choose from) that I remotely begin to like.  The language feels forced; the word pictures are dingy at best.

As Ms. Rowling did with the Harry Potter series-she introduces you in great detail to each important character, and she has done the same with ""A Casual Vacancy"".  I know that I began to wane a bit as well in the first part of the book--but don't give up because once you know everyone and their role in the entire story-it is so very worth it.  Parminder, and Fats, and Andy,Tessa, Samantha, Howard--and Krystal, they all must be introduced to the reader so you understand what's to come.  The story really takes off halfway through and it becomes the ""book you can't put down"".  The ending is fascinating--how all the different personalities and actions people took affect the outcome is, well, real life.  And the small town aspect of it is very true.

Once I got it, it became easier and I did not want to put the book down. I identified with some of the characters, cheered for some while hating others. I like the fact that the story has no mystery for the reader to uncover. There is mystery within the story however, but the characters are the ones left to wonder and ponder. The reader is not lost trying to figure out anything, we can ride along knowing what's happening. There are some shocking elements throughout the story. It's not a book for everyone.

Boring??  I thought it was anything but.  I thought she could make a tense dinner party just as exciting as a wizard duel.  The writing was top notch, very polished, and the pace flowed beautifully.  I also thought the characters were so well realized and believable. I've heard the complaint that so many were unlikable, and that is fine with me.  I don't need saintly characters, there are so few of them in real life, but I want characters that read real and are complex and interesting and I personally found this to be the case here.  In even the worst characters, she gave me insight into why they are the way they are.  I didn't think she excused anyone's behavior in the book, but at least gave some understanding of what led to the behavior.  I found the ending incredibly moving and emotional, just a powerful book.  And the story was very relevant.  Not an American book, not set in America, but after this past election I thought the exploration of rich and poor and how the rich views and treats the poor was handled very well.

Wainwright,No warmth!,"Rowling obviously did not intend to paint working class society in UK as a warm and fuzzy bunch, but immediately, in the first chapter, killing off the only individual who seems to have had some warmth or charitable quality, results in a book full of rather unlikable individuals.  None of the long list of characters have any genuine affection for each other, so it is very difficult to root for anyone.  Self distructive, on the road to nowhere, the characters become rather cartoonish, like the Dursley's in 'Harry Potter'.  I would even go as far as to say that her characters are so mean, they are unrealistic.  Life has redeeming aspects to it as well as tragedies, so despite the love of the acerbic, this book disappointed me.

The story, the writing, the characters, everything was just a perfect compilation of what a fantasy book should be. Completely plausible within it's own world, great descriptions, and page-turning suspense at times, Harry Potter obviously inspired a generation to read. So, when I heard that J.K. Rowling was writing a completely non-fantasy, adult drama, I was skeptical. But, as a fan, I believed she could do it, and I was interested in seeing what she did with it. I work in a data-entry, so I have a lot of time to listen to audiobooks. Once it came out, i got the audiobook and got through it in about 2 1/2 days. And its okay. Its not amazing by any stretch, but i wasn't really expecting it to be. I came into it with a completely blank slate, because children's fantasy and adult drama are very different genre's, and i was equally prepared to be disappointed or awed that she had done it again.

It's a cruel book. Cruel to the characters, who are egregiously depraved each in their own way, and cruel to the reader, who keeps plowing through pages with the belief that something must happen, that this story must matter in some way or would not have been allowed to be published.

2012-12-06,R1VIUX6ILNEAD6,Susan K. Schoonover,The Ghost Of Barry Fairbrother,THE CASUAL VACANCY is an above average book that has a great deal to say about some of the more negative aspects of human nature.  Of course the reader has to be willing to stay with the novel past its very confusing and uninviting start to get to the interesting character studies and darkly humorous main plot that centers around the pettiness of small city politics.  The book begins with the unexpected death of the saintly Barry Fairbrother who served on the town's parish council.  We are introduced to many of the townspeople through their reaction to his sudden passing and by the time of his funeral we have a pretty good understanding of the identity and foibles of the main players.  Parents and their teenage children are a major component of the book and J.K. Rowling shows the same understanding of the difficulties of coming of age that she did in the Harry Potter books. However THE CASUAL VACANCY is definitely a book written for adults or very mature adolescents as it is much more graphic in its depictions of some of the realities of life than the Potter books.  I hope J.K.Rowling continues to publish novels for both adults and children as she is a very talented storyteller with a great ability to create realistic characters.

I don't often read fiction, much less 500 pages of it, and I rarely cry, so Rowling hit a nerve. I even gained an insight. One of the characters reminded me of a ""ne'er do well"" I attended high school with. Because of this book, I see her, 45 years later, with more compassion. I'm not promising this will happen to you, but it's amazing how some stories can change your perspective. If a book can make me even a little bit more compassionate, I give it all the stars I can, since learning compassion is one of life's hardest lessons.",5.0

The story too was interesting, but the hero of the book, we'll we don't get to know him all that well and he was the most interesting of all. Everyone else in this tale (or almost everyone else) are people I couldn't stand.

The main characters were a boring cast of petty, superficial, self-serving, and sociopathic individuals whose social interactions blended together to fuel an assortment of human tragedies. It is the last J K Rowling book aimed for adults that i will ever purchase. It left me wondering if Rowling created such a magical  fantasy world in the HP series as a therapeutic escape from the world of mere muggles  (humans) which she clearly views with a disgusted and nauseous eye within The Casual Vacancy.

Every one of the characters was unhappy, depressed and emotionally unstable.  There is not one redeeming, believable character in the entire book.  Take any social awareness issues that have happened in the last 30 years and put them in one book; unhappy wives, abusive husbands and fathers, rape, drugs, prostitution, pedophiles, child molestation, suicide, unsafe sex, teens suffering from angst and depression,  and you have a Casual Vacancy.

The natural world, to the extent it's present at all, is under attack, and drugs abound.  Nevertheless,it's a story of how the most unpromising looking adolescents can be interesting and lovable and even good.This is not all that common with any writer, but English writers, in particular, tend to come down pretty hard on the young.

I thought it had the possibility to be great having read all the Harry Potter books and expecting the same depth of plot and richness of characters. However I found Barry Fairweather's death disappointingly early.  The teens lacked authenticity. The adults were confusingly indistinct in some parts of the book and local politics are just not that thrilling. The plot was enough for a short story but not for a book. Rowling used her usual rich description but I found myself wanting more story line.  I bought it at the airport and put it down well before the end of my eight hour flight...,1.0

The characters in this book were dull, uninteresting, and in all cases the most unappealing mean spirited people that could possibly live in one town. The entire town of Pagford and The Fields was at war ,and one could only deplore man's inhumanity to man as represented in all of Rowling's characters in this book.

The town of Pagford, England, is peopled by Rowling with a wide-ranging assortment of characters, whose thoughts propel the story. I'm reminded of John Updike and early Stephen King (before verbosity took over), who are unsurpassed at getting inside their characters' heads. Some who didn't like this novel have complained that the characters were unlikable, that they had no redeeming qualities. I would ask these critics about the innermost thoughts of their own friends and neighbors, and even themselves. If we knew what everyone was really thinking, would we find them likable? Would we want others to know our own innermost thoughts? A writer does not operate under these constraints and is under no obligation make her characters user friendly.

I enjoy this style because of the detailed descriptions of the characters and their interactions. A key to this type of fiction is the sharply drawn images of individual emotions of the characters.

If this had been her first work, I don't think she would have had the phenomenal success she had with Harry Potter. People paid to read this book based on her previous work. I can say that as a writer moving in this direction she has potential - in many ways her work resembles P.D James in that she shines a spot light on people as they really are, warts and all.

I started the book wondering how she would develop an interesting story based on such a small village and a relatively simple plot, but she did it well.

Where it was hard to put the Harry Potter books down because we liked the characters so much, it is hard to keep reading The Casual Vacancy because we like the characters so little. What was fascinating to me was just how different the two worlds are that Rowling has created. Harry Potter is about good vs. evil, friendship, loyalty, self-sacrifice,  and survival on a grand scale.  The Casual Vacancy is about the life of a small village of no particular importance filled with dysfunctional people who are destroyed.  Most of the characters are petty and self-absorbed, doing what they think they need to do to survive regardless of the havoc it causes for someone else. There is shocking meanness in the book. There is disturbing, raw vulgarity and exploitative sex. There is no love, and almost no charity. Yet, to my surprise, I cried at the end.  The Casual Vacancy is in many ways the antithesis of the Harry Potter books.  As such it shows Rowling to have quite a range as a writer. I didn't enjoy reading The Casual Vacancy the same way I enjoyed reading Harry Potter, but I'm glad I read it.  It was thought-provoking.  There are 3, maybe 4, women who are admirable in the book,who try to help others.  I think they will be what sticks with me, plus Rowling's point that it is easy to judge a person's actions but hard to understand them if you don't know their secrets or motives for acting.",4.0

This is a mature book that aims to some extent to strike at the literary fiction market. One gets the feeling that Rowling has somehow made a challenge to herself to write something that is significantly more challenging (to read) than anything else she has accomplished; the challenge in this case lies in the equivocal portrayal of people in ""TCV"". It's this subtle point, I think, that many one-star reviews have failed to grasp: the human psyche is complex and can't help what it thinks - people are not simply ""good"" or ""evil"". Of course I sympathise with the expectations of her fans and their adventurous excursion to non-fantasy realms (many of my friends who only have read fantasy have dipped their toes in other waters for the first time with this book), however one must not approach a book with your own prejudices - absorb and discard that which appeals to you or has truth to it.",4.0

2012-11-18,R313BOA46IFKJ6,Greenista,Worthwhile Read and Smart Ending,"JK Rowling's first adult book is certainly a deviation from her Harry Potter series, but her character development and insight into the lives and inner thoughts of the characters is insightful and entertaining.  The book is slow for the first 100 pages or so as she spends time exploring the motivations and personalities of all those involved in the book's plot, but once she sets the stage the second half of the book is captivating and a quick read.  The way she demonstrates how the actions of one character determine the fate of another is impressive and leaves you thinking about the book long after you're done.  Keep reading until the end and you will not be disappointed!!!  Overall, I highly recommend this book.",5.0

She certainly does not hesitate to use her library of ""bad words"" in just the first few pages.  But I fell for the buy me and learned a lesson to never jump at a book just because it has so many great previous books.

After a week,  I admit to speed reading whole chapters finding them sordid and not conducive to late night reading. Not that all books have to be uplifting, but the banality of the characters gave no insights, no compassion is evoked by the miserable lot of them. I tried to pick up later in the book, looking for a crumb that would inspire thoughtfulness and inspire me to quit this skimming.

2012-11-17,R2MFOUMIIPHPK1,IBCoconutty,Brilliant Book for Adult Readers (if you like Roddy Doyle),"I listened to the audio version of this book(narrated by Tom Hollander.)  It is a masterpiece that propels JK Rowling into another dimension of artistry.  I am a huge fan of her Harry Potter series and was aware that this novel was a deviation from children's lit into a more mature direction.  It is gritty, realistic, profane, sadistic, deeply disturbing in parts.  It challenges the reader to understand the characters motives and not judge them only on their actions.  At it's core, it is a character study that totally engages the reader and makes you care about the outcome for each character.  This book inspires comparison to some of my other favorite authors, Roddy Doyle and even Barbara Vine (minus the mystery).  Tom Hollander's narration was perfect in every way.  His vocal gymnastics portrayed each character with it's own voice and personality.  I have contemplated some of the negative reviews on this site and wonder if these reviewers would have been so harsh had the author not had another book series that had such an impact as HP.  Some reviewers seem almost angry that Rowling would deign to ""turn over the rock"" of the human experience and explore the ugliest aspects of life.  However, after reading this book, one comes away with a deeper compassion for others who we may have judged unfairly.  One sees her profound respect for the teenage trial --the terror and humilation of the teenage years that as adults we slowly forget.  Rowling allows her characters to adapt and to change for the better or worse. This book has inspired me to be more compassionate toward others and less judgemental.",5.0

Clearly they have nothing in common and there should be no comparison. In any case, I really liked this book. I want to say I loved it, but I had a few issues, so I won't go all '5 Stars' but it's close. In the beginning, I did have trouble keeping the characters straight but by the end of the book, it was no longer an issue. Maybe it's because I live in a small town that I found the entire story completely believable. The political alliances and back room shennanigans with regards to local elections is intense to say the least. I loved the way all these lives intertwined, even though the people themselves don't realize it. I couldn't help but remember the line from ""It's A Wonderful Life"": ""One man's life touches so many others."" My one complaint is that I wish there was more closure on some characters storylines.

How come in almost every negative review I have read the reviewer has made some comparison to the Harry Potter franchise? And if it's not a direct comparison it's some lame joke like ""there's no magic here."" Is that supposed to be clever? You wouldn't compare two different movies a director made would you? No. So don't do that with this book.

Rowling who wrote it and she is my favourite author. However, I kept reading it because it captivated me. I liked, loved, pitied, despised and hated the characters. I raged against some and cried with the others. This is the kind of book that makes you think. It makes you evaluate your own self, your own worth, your own values. What would you do? Would you do anything at all? Would you just go past, not caring, because it's not your problem, not your fight? Would such circumstances make you crumble or rise? Would they bring out the worst or the best in you? I think that these are all very important questions and I applaud J.K. Rowling for raising them in such a brutal, honest way, not being afraid of using the language and the imagery that will appal and repel, showing the ugly side of life that so many of us pretend not to see, though it exists right next to us, and the inevitability of tragedy that comes from neglect, irresponsibility and abandonment. I think it took a lot of courage to write about all of this, knowing, as she did, that such a book would raise many objections, that its worth would be overlooked because of who she is, its language would be abused, its subject matter misunderstood and ridiculed. It made me cry. It broke my heart. But it gave me hope too. I know that the story didn't come to an end with the full stop.

2012-11-13,R2O6T8PAYA5JU5,Sharasa Kerbouchard,Give it a Chance,"Yes, I am a huge fan of Harry Potter. Yes, I knew it was not a children's book. Yes, I found it difficult to begin and to sustain through the first portion of the book. Yes, I found it immensely good after I got into it. I knew going into this novel it was not a children's book. I was also, for some reason, expecting a mystery type book (this isn't), and that, too was difficult to work through as I began to read the book on its own merit.  It is hard, though, to distance yourself from Rowling as Harry's creator and Rowling as the voice of Pagford. However, I really reminded myself that it was a different book with a different purpose and if I kept reading I would find something of merit. Was I ever right. I am amazed at Rowling's ability to distance herself from children's literature and write a very adult novel using very adult language and themes. It was a huge break from the past and one that took bravery and daring to write. I was also amazed at the development of the characters and the plot lines. Each character had a unique and distinct voice. I think what was difficult for me at first was keeping them all separate, however, once they are all introduced and you are moved between them and among them and introduced to each of them through the other characters, I was amazed at the intricacy with which it was written. As far as writer's craft goes, it is excellent. As the plot continues to unfold, Rowling continues to tie one person's observations and interpretations into another character's reality...and let me say...they are not always one and the same. Truly, things are not as they appear in Pagford, and the necessity of ""keeping up appearances"" hides a lot of pain and misery. No, it is not a happy book (although there are moments of lightheartedness and wit), but just because it is not happy and does not sugar coat reality does not make it any less compelling. It took me a long time to read it. I began in September when it came out and I just finished in mid-November. Mainly because the beginning was difficult for me to sustain. Once I determined I was going to go back to it, and got past all the introductions, it flew and I finished the remaining 2/3 in just a couple of days (my reading time is limited). If you are a Harry fan, please try to separate yourself from the other series. If you give the book a chance on its own merit, you may be surprised at how involved you become in empathizing with (or hating) some of the characters. I am convinced to go back and re-read the beginning, now that I am more in touch with the characters...I will enjoy it more the second time around. The 4 stars are because of the slow beginning. The remaining was a 5.",4.0

The writing and story are truthful and gritty. Although the plot revolves around small town British life, it digs deep into the psyche of the picture postcard town exposing it's pretty nasty underbelly.

2012-11-13,R2W770PKW6RVXU,Marci,I really enjoyed it!,"Yes, I truly read Casual Vacancy...not once, but twice now. I also attended the NYC event where J.K. Rowling spoke about her new book, got to meet her and have my book signed. It was very informative and gave me many new perspectives to think about once I read it a 2nd time. When I first started reading the book I thought...""What the F?...""did she just say that?"" and ""we are not in Hogwarts anymore""...and it was quite slow at the start, however I pushed on, and as I kept reading I became more and more engrossed in the story. This is NOT a book for Kids! Sorry,  if that is what you were expecting,you are in for a huge surprise, and J.K.Rowling warned us all about it too. Nothing is ""sugar coated"" here. J.K. tells a gritty, risky, and at times disturbing tale, about the reality that is life in many places in the world. Though there where many moments and scenes that I (as a HP reader) could just not believe that this was the same writer of that magical books we all grew to love, however there were also many scenes where J.K. Rowling's humor and genius truly shines. She did not write this book purely for shock value or because ""she could""...she wrote it because she truly believed in her story, and in her characters. The book makes you think, it makes you have to see what potentially you might not be ready to see or swallow. This is one of the reasons I think many people find it off-putting. There are many things through out the story that could have happened to ourselves, or to people we know...ugly truths that most people don't want to face. By the time I was 50-60 pages in I just could not put it down. I laughed and I cried, and though it was not fantasy, or Harry...it was wonderful. I highly recommend it, to anyone ""GROWN UP"" enough to face the truths within it.",5.0

2012-11-12,RK0AHXI49UCC5,Charlotte Hansen,Disappointed,"J.K. Rowling is not the first author to make the jump from youth fiction to adult fiction.  Others have done so with varying degrees of success.  However, I don't believe I've ever known of an author who tried so desperately to distance themselves from their former work that they were virtually guaranteed to alienate 80% of even their adult fan base.  Harry Potter attracted plenty of adult fans; I'm not sure who Rowling thought she was going to attract to this book.  I had heard before I started reading that there was going to be offensive language and sex; but the book sounded interesting, and I had so much respect for Rowling as a story teller that I decided that I was willing to put up with that if the story was good.  I'm no prude, and this is certainly not the first book I've read with ""R"" rated language in it.  However, it will go down as the single most offensive book I have ever attempted to read.  By page 26, I found that I was unwilling to wade through any more garbage.  The characters were not even remotely likable.  I felt like I was watching maggots crawl through rotting flesh - some might find it interesting, but I was revolted.  I'm afraid that with ""The Casual Vacancy"",  J.K.

What took J.D. Salinger to describe in The Catcher in the Rye, Rowling does in The Casual Vacancy, but across more characters and age groups. I am not saying that Rowling's work is inferior at all, but she can plumb the depths of the human soul with all it's earnestness, hypocrisy, pain, vengefulness, passions high and low, like Salinger. However, Rowling uses a dozen major characters, almost all well developed and tangible, instead of two.

These characters, including the children, were horrible people that I didn't care about in the slightest.  Nor did I care about their whiny plight to be unified in their hatred and disgust of those less fortunate and less ""perfect"" than themselves.

It didn't necessarily get cheery, but the storylines and characters certainly got compelling, thought-provoking and emotion-provoking.  What I thought of as ""dreary"" early on became something else - something I can't name, something which made me think that the world is not always so nice a place, and that it's good to have compassion for others in it.  Neither of these messages are delivered by being pedantic or using cliches, though.  Instead they are conveyed by simply telling the stories and presenting the characters as-is, almost as if it's a documentary or bit of journalism, and letting the stories and characters' actions lead you to your own reactions and conclusion.

So when I saw you were releasing a new book, I honestly felt I owed it to you to purchase it and try it out, in thanks for the years of enjoyment of your writing. I was truly excited about it. I counted down the days to the release. I in no way expected it to be a Harry Potter-level masterpiece. I did, however, expect your novel to be interesting and enjoyable. I regret to say that, though I go typically through books with enthusiastic fervor, it took me over a month to finish your book. I can finish just about any book in two days flat if I'm enjoying it. I soak up the written word like a very thirsty sponge. But I just could not get into this book. I could not in any way get excited for what would happen next. It seemed to me to be an overall aimless plot, topped off with a sad and dramatic ending that in no way matched the pace of the rest of the book. It was like boringboringboring, then BAM- dramatic, tragic ending. I really cannot understand what possessed you to write it. The petty happenings of small town life simply do not strike me as engaging subject matter. I feel there were too many characters (boring ones, at that). It took me at least until halfway through the book to even differentiate between them all. Overall, this book gave me a sad face :( At the least, I expected an entertaining read.

This is not the 8th Harry Potter book, and it's important not to have the expectation that it will be like Harry Potter. This is a stand alone book that is amazing not because of its plot, but because of the depth of the characters. No character in the book is black or white, and just when you think that you have correctly classified a character as weak or mean, J.K Rowling throws something in to change your mind completely. The Casual Vacancy draws the reader into the complex relationships of a town in England. The town is so realistic that I found myself thinking of the people in the book as real people. This is a book will stay with you for days after you finish it, and will make you question the way you live your life.

The locale of Pagford village struggles to  overcome it's Victorian distaste for those in poverty and those of different ethnic family backgrounds. Only the ghost of a main character, Barry Fairweather, who dies of a brain aneurism in the first few paragraphs, offers any reprieve from the humorless problems and tribulations of the others left to play out the destiny of Pagford politics. Realism seems to be the reason that frequent use of the ""F"" word becomes common-place by  characters seeking to get attention to their difficulties.

Why, you would ask. Because I love the way she writes. Classy and giving immense importance to details which not a lot of writers do. Even tiny details like what the character is eating gives a very personalized feel to the reader and practically takes him inside the book,as if everything is happening for real. But I guess my expectations were higher for this book. I expected a political story, as the name suggests, some dirty politics and an exciting climax. Till the very end I was hoping that something would happen which would make me think ""ooh i did not expect that"".

As the story builds, the characters begin to fill out and the reader (one hopes) starts to become cognizant of the very deep cruelty and deprivation that results from social policies made by securely self righteous people.  The author brings it all down home to the costs in human suffering that are the result of self-seeking policies.  Her characters are rich and interesting, noone escaping her xray vision for foibles and flaws.  Suspense builds as the book goes on and the reader takes sides.  Her adolescent characters are particularly well-drawn, with nothing held back in her depiction of the dog-eat-dog world of adolescence.

It is pretty difficult to read for the average reader because it jumps from one character's story to the next, all relating to this devestating event.  What makes this book so intense is that it deals with real life.  You can pretty much take these characters in these different situations and apply them to any city in any country.  We all know the Howard and Shirleys in our town; people who need to be kicked off their high horse.  We all know the Barrys in our town that try to make it a better place.  We all know the variety of teenagers like Andrew, Fats, and Krystal.  Some of J. K. Rowling's writing style is meant to be read as a Monty Python actor with a sense of British humor.  I will have to admit, I was shocked by the first 100 pages with the words and phrases J. K. Rowling used.  It is also why I liked this book because it is so different from Harry Potter, and I LOVE Harry Potter.  Its a shame that people judge a book by its cover rather than the actual story.

This proves she can write for adults even when the real focus of her story are the children, struggling through adolescence, vulnerable, and as agents creating the tragic story arc that leads to unpleasant truths, tattered relationships, self awareness, and death.  This  isn't hogwarts and the ending is bleak and unsettling.  Her individual portraits rival Sherwood Anderson's masterful collection of grotestiques that he created in Winesburg Ohio.  Each is sharply drawn and their fobiles and failures clearly drawn.  Krystal, of course, is the real and tragic heroine of the story.

This book's characters reminded me a bit of the characters in Ruth Rendall's books, though perhaps not quite as quirky.  They all had their issues and problems and even though other people may have thought certain people were a certain way or had perfect lives, we were able to see into their lives and to see the issues and problems they all were grappling with.

I took this book to the trash masher dumpster to make sure no one could take it out to read.  I have never done that with a book before.  The book is all about bullying.  The parents bully the kids, the kids bully the parents and their teachers and their peers, the parents bully their friends.  And there is no saving grace in the whole book.  What was the point in writing it?  It gave no hope that this practice could be contained or ways to change it. It seems like the author is promoting bullying.

Ms Rowling's panache for character development in her Harry Potter series was so impressive and captivating that I couldn't wait to read her new novel Casual Vacancy. I wish that I had waited and waited and actually never bought the book. Simply put, Casual Vacancy is the worst book I have ever read. There is not once shred of goodness in this book at all. Walt Disney once said, ""For every laugh there should be a tear."" Well, Casual Vacancy is nothing but tears. Even though, Ms Rowling is known for her keen sense of character development, there is not one character in the book that is likable or has any redeeming qualities, much less a character that the average reader could relate to or give empathy. I had high hopes for this book, but those hopes were dashed after about the first fifty pages. I actually thought that the more I would read, the book would get much better. Instead it became more difficult to get through and, of course, the ending was the worst. I am shocked that Ms Rowling would write such a second rate novel when her other works are first class.",1.0

I probably could have made myself sit and read the complete book, but why bother?  I hated every single one of the characters and frankly didn't care if they all were killed by some mass murderer.

I was excited to read this book, even knowing it was not about Hogwarts.  I was disappointed, but NOT because it isn't another Harry Potter.  The book is very dark and really a huge downer.  Harry Potter was often times dark and dealt with death.  However, the Harry Potter novels remained hopeful.  There was a light at the end of a tunnel and a continuing belief in the ultimate goodness in people.  I did not find any kind of hope in the Casual Vacancy and this is what bothered me the most.  Also, Harry Potter is full of memorable, likeable characters.  I did not find any of the characters here very likable.  A few I felt very sorry for (Krystal, Sukhvindar) but there were none I was really rooting for.  Most of the characters were desperately selfish and almost pitiful (like Samantha, Gavin).  All this said, Rowling is a tremendous writer.  Despite my dislike of the characters, I finished the book and found parts of it compelling.  I will qualify all this by saying I don't really read ""sad"" novels.  If that's your thing, you might like this.  I felt very blue after finishing the book.

Rowling's determination to write about real life and move beyond her roots in fantasy makes me think of a child who consciously makes herself  the polar opposite of her parents and is therefore still under their influence.

As the names and roles are fleshed out, the tale comes together nicely. My expectation for this book was for it not to be remotely like Harry Potter and Rowling meets that.

While I was not expecting another Harry Potter novel I was expecting to at least see a bit of JK's humor and style of writing a bit more. The subject matter was not edge of your seat interesting and she jumped very quickly from charactor to charactor (so much so that I often found myself re-reading paragraphs in order to see who I was reading about) and it all seemed a bit forced and jumbled at times. I still found myself wanting to know what happened to the charactors but not so much thatI would call this a ""cant put you down"" book.  While I still look forward to more from her I must say that her first offical forray into ""adult reading"" missed the mark a bit. I think she may have tried too hard to branch away from her HP image with this one.

It is heavy on character development, which many seem to decry...the Amazon reviews lament that and lack of plot. Well..in my humble opinion too few authors develop their characters, and she does a smashing job here :-) had to sound a tad British. You will recognize many of the characters in your families, friends, neighbors; I cared deeply for many, loathed quite a few, and feared for others. At one point, when you see what is going to happen, you will be shouting through the pages for characters to see what is right in front of them..as you would in a horror movie when someone is about to go off alone etc. Point of view is expressed beautifully...along with it denial, rationalization, and justification. She is depicting life, and despite it hitting close to home, and perhaps not the escape some Amazon readers want, I truly admire her writing for so, so many reasons. Yeah, a traditional plot line would be hard to summarize here...but if you can't stand the cardboard characters in so many novels you come across, pick this up, and read it.",5.0

I made it through the first 60 pages, but someone would have to pay me a lot of money to finish it. I have really lost respect for J.K. Rowling. She obviously does not care about her loyal readers who got her where she is today.

However, it was given to me recently as a gift and I was thrilled to read in Rolling's pioneer effort. As a writer, I like to support other authors, even when I am not sure about the book at first. The first few pages with too many characters thrown at the reader confused me. I had to refer back and forth time and time again and went on ahead. By page 149, I thought good heavens, when is a PLOT going to happen. Rolling's talent is definitely with character development and I came to know them well and pictured them in my mind. The plot finally did unravel and at a fast speed, and the book was worth hanging on with. I always like to see a moral angle in a book and I was not disappointed. I certainly applaud Rolling for stepping into new territory and would support her in anything she does as many of us do. This book? Glad I read it, I would be very hesitant to recommend it without saying to other readers know that in my view, it's a long read with paydirt coming way down the line. Also, my largest objection is the profanity from seemingly EVERY character had; it was not necessary. It got tiresome and offensive, frankly. I would love to sit down with Rolling or hear from her as to why she made everyone so profanity speaking, it really wasn't necessary.

Oh my god, it was painful. I am not the kind of person who puts down  a book, but about fifty pages into the book, I was filled with inexplicable hatred for everything in my life  - my friends, my family, even myself. It is amazing how manipulative this book can be. The absolute absence of even a hint of happiness within the characters and the plot is one of the reasons this book makes me rage for no apparent reason. That all of the people in this book have hearts of coal and reflect human selfishness in every aspect is another. I was seriously tempted to stop reading midway, because this book was ruining my mood and destroying my faith in humanity. After finishing, however, and looking back, this was actually composed pretty well. It had the touch of philosophy I value the most in books, and the vocabulary was splendid.

2012-10-31,R1TG55JIHEER4F,Sillymeg,Review from a ex-pat English Woman,"I was intrigued in buying this book because I am an avid Harry Potter fan and I enjoy the storytelling abilities of JK Rowling.  When I started this book it wasn't what I expected, it was completely the opposite and I wasn't a fan originally of the book. I felt that it was lacking a conherent plot and no action or a story line.  However, as I read on I felt like it was more a social commentary on modern day English life, and the politics and problems that plague England and could be applied to other parts of the world.  While I was in love with the book like Harry Potter, I felt that JK Rowling is an excellent story teller and the ending was super exciting and amazing!!!! While I would agree with other reviewers that it was a great book but I throughly enjoyed it and would recommend it to people to read!!",4.0

As her books have had such phenomenal success, it is not strange that her new book will have success too. I highly recommend it, if you like books, which begin with the death of one of her positives characters and end with the death of the second one. The book, as any contemporary novel vying for commercialc success, contains all modern ills:school bullying, the resulting (?) self-mutilation, addiction to drugs and all the modern explanation of it--poverty, maternal elect ... The admiration for promiscuity ( the characteristic of her main  character) , the disdain for middle class virtues... The comparison of the obesity of  one of a major taxpayer in the community and the expense of the NHS to treat it with the expense of the treatment of a drug addict , made by an Indian GP! (another bow to a modern novel with diverse characters!). Anyway, it is a realistic portrayal of modern England and its welfare state!",3.0

To me, this book was a rambling plotline about a small foreign town, all of its politics and character flaws. No one in this book was even vaguely good or slightly wholesome in anyway. It was like she tried to write the opposite of her Harry Potter series and ended up with this unattractive mix of British slang and bad attitudes. Nothing was resolved by the end of the story and I am not really sure where she was trying to take the readers. Overall, I was underwhelmed with the end result. I have been told that J.K. Rowling is going back to children's books permanently, and if that is the case not only is it for the better but she also realizes where her strengths and weaknesses are.

Interesting the way she linked together the fates of seemingly unrelated lives, demonstrating the profound effect that their past and present situations, beliefs and actions had on others around them;  intended or not.

2012-10-30,R2FGEX3OR94F7G,Sacramento,Interesting in theory,"Having done a lot of work with foster kids and families in situations like the Weedon's I appreciated J.K. Rowling using her influence and writing to shed light on the complexities of this subject. And I also found the interactions between the teenageers and parents in this book interesting. About halfway through the book it got interesting with the ghost and as the ending came to a head the reader is interested to see if it will end as they suspect but other than those moments it is dull and depressing. Rowling does a good job describing people and situations but somehow the characters and events are not compelling enough. There is no easy solution to poverty, addiction, prejudice, or teenage angst and so the reader knows the book will not provide solutions to the key problems highlighted in the book. And so the reader is left feeling depressed at the parent-teen relationships (which are all bad to terrible in this book) and at the poverty, addiction, and prejudice. The book is useful in shedding light on this subject for those who are naive or not already familiar with the complexities of these issues but for those already daily familiar with these topics, it provides no satisfaction at all. So I both congratulate Rowling for her courage to tackle this subject and have to admit to not really enjoying the book all that much as I pushed myself to finish it.",3.0
2012-10-30,R23DTTNBB86EMO,Theresa Edwards,My Cup of Tea,"Harry Potter was not my cup of tea; realistic fiction and nonfiction suited me much more than fantasy.  But thanks to the relentless urging of my kids to read the books and see the movies, I am now an unlikely Potter fan; I think they're called Potter Heads.  So I was intrigued when Rawlings came out with a more realistic piece of fiction for adults.  I just finished The Casual Vacancy, and it was GREAT.  Just a caveat, that the first few chapters will throw out a lot of characters and back story.  Some books include a summary of characters, and that would have been helpful with this one to get all the players straight.  But about a quarter of the way through the book, everything starts blending together, and the political intrigue, plotting and conniving between the villagers build deliciously.  Almost everyone has an ax to grind, skeleton in their closet, or some petty self-serving motivation.  You may see yourself in some of the characters.  Due to adult subject matter and language, it is not suitable for children or teens in my opinion.  Many of the villagers grow a bit, some remain stagnant, and some come to a terrible end.  I find myself wanting to read a sequel to see how everyone evolves, perhaps with new characters, like a thinly disguised Snape as the new school headmaster . . .",4.0

It is quite vulgar at times especcialy when the teens are talking and also remarkably spitefull; bullying, ethnic problems and especially the bad relationships between parents and their off-spring is documented with a great deal of detail.

The book is short on nobility, self-sacrifice, altruism, and fantasy does not exist, except in the minds of some characters, and such fantasy has thus far been either violent or sexual.  Ms. Rowling knows some four-letter words, too.  But I intend to finish it, because she can definitely write, and I want to know how it ends.

I do not understand the highly critical and negative reviews, which inevitably raise the HP series in comparison. Rowling is an talented writer and I think it is fantastic to see her pushing the perceived boundaries. In some ways it reminds me of Bob Dylan going electric way back in the mid 1960's, when some people went ape because he was expressing himself outside of the public perceived boundaries of his previous (folk music) genre.

When Barry Fairbrother unexpectedly dies, the town is left with much unanticipated circumstances. A casual vacancy, as it is known on the town's Parish Council.  The town has been going through a long term political struggle over who is responsible for the costs of supporting the poverty stricken area, the Fields. Fairbrother was an ally of those who wanted to maintain support for the Fields, and with his death, the two opposing sides square off. The politics of the Parish Council only set the stage for the book. The turmoil is the stage for the real story about the variety of people who call the town home and their daily struggle in life.",3.0

Yes, it was long, but because of JKR's writing skills it was a much quicker read than many other more turgid books with fewer pages. Yes, there were a lot of characters. That worked for me, too. It took a while to keep all of them straight, just like when one joins a new family, however ultimately they became a most interesting mosaic which clearly illustrated life in a small town. Yep, many of the characters were unlikable, but isn't that often the case everywhere? The book clearly paints the conservative versus liberal positions (in which we in the U.S. are a few years behind Britain, where their austerity program isn't working out well). While the book had a sad ending, it clearly showed that even the most disadvantaged of us have dreams of a better life.",5.0

I listened to the audiobook and had a little trouble keeping the multiple plots, each with a cast of dysfuntional characters, straight.  However, I couldn't turn it off as I remained interested in how the story would play out.  The story is a realistic reflection of life in a small English village, and we who live in the US can relate to how local politics become such a big deal to those who are involved.  The teenagers were sympathetic (and horrifying) as they attempt to survive the antics of the adults who govern their lives.

2012-10-26,R19U4R5VSGDFJ3,Ken Moe,Jane Austen Lives!,"Jane Austen has come to life again in the 21st century, this time unfettered by 19th century literary conventions curtailing sex and foul language. Ms. Austen was not afraid to write about unlikeable people, and J. K. Rowling has shown that same courage in this work. Having served as a pastor and denominational official in rural Pennsylvania, I had no difficulty transposing the inhabitants of Pagford and Yarvil to America. Rowling's characters are real. I've known these people by other names with different regional dialects in another country. This is not a book to assuage one's hunger for a simple triumph of good over evil, but rather to motivate commitment for social justice. The realistic nature of this novel is not for the faint of heart but is bracing for those who seek truth in fiction.",5.0

2012-10-26,R1KKWF6EMZZCC9,E. Collier,Casual Vacancy missed the mark,"Stick to the age group that garnered so much success with Harry Potter.  I was extremely disappointed.  The plot doesn't move fast enough and when everything started to come together, it simply fizzled out.  British readers probably understood the slang and the profane words, but I didn't think that they added anything to the story.  The ending really made me wonder why I had read the book in the first place.",2.0
2012-10-26,R2HTJCV8JXE5WG,road reader,Gifted and Grim,"Rowling writes a ""Casual Vacancy"" with the ambition, imagination, and scope of a multi book series. In this delivery, her amazing gift is her downfall. There are too many characters: multiple unlikeable families of age stepped, flawed participants who yell, scream, complain, whine, or moan their way through the chapters of the book. Most chapters are depressing and exhausting. This overly ambitious statement of contemporary life in the small, seemingly charming, English town of Pagford is neither kind nor uplifting. In many instances, the introduction of yet another ugly, grave, social issue made me want to stop reading. Woven throughout the lives of the Pagford inhabitants is the theme of class and caste preoccupation in it's very English way; by the middle of the book the town of Pagford, itself, has become an ugly character. This may be the most telling statement of all about contemporary English life. The book provides a rich tapestry of social issues in Pagford, and that feat is Rowling's genius. Unfortuneately, it does not translate to a compelling story. Too often, the story is repelling. As an avid reader of convincing yarns, I am disappointed in this effort. As a writer, I am envious of Rowling's seemingly endless gift.",3.0

HOWEVER, this book grabbed me and hooked me in immediately. I loved it. All the characters were rounded out, the main story flowed even though it was made up of lots of threads that would all tie up at the end. It may not be Harry Potter but then it was never meant to be, nor is it a children's story. I would definitely recommend it as a damned good read!

At first, I had trouble following the characters, as there are certainly many of them, and they are introduced wicked fast, but JKR did a great job reminding you who was who without being repetitive. It is a very deep, very adult-themed novel, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. With all of the different sociological issues (rich at war with the impoverished, parents and children, adults and adolescents, and even racial tensions, as well as exploring domestic violence and bullying), it was a page turner to the very end. It was stark, realistic, and a far cry from the Wizarding novels of JKR's renown, but it was fantastic. I just wouldn't recommend it to someone under 13.",4.0

Also, because it was written by J.K., I had faith that it couldn't be as plodding as it seemed and that soon she would wind it all up into something.  Didn't happen for me at all.

2012-10-26,R2MVMOGLTZOXWF,Jennifer A. Slater,My kids got the best of her...,"The Harry Potter series was a once in a lifetime experience, one that will probably continue as long as there are children who continually reach the age where they can read a book of that size, and as long as there are adults who realize they never experienced it.  I had to buy 3 copies of each of the 7 books in that series, one for each of my children, because they couldn't wait to dive back into the magic they knew they were about to experience.  After the first book came out, the remaining six found me camped out in a lawn chair and a sleeping bag with my kids waiting for Target to open their doors so we could race inside and grab the next installment.  Even as an adult these books blew me away with the depth and unfathomable imagination that Ms. Rowling possesses.  Which is why, when I heard she had authored a book for grown-ups, I absolutely could not wait.  I was now going to be able to experience the can't-put-it-down ride that children across the world had been enjoying for years.  I'm telling you all this because this fierce expectation I had for an adult version of Ms. Rowling's talent may be part of the reason why I was so disappointed with The Casual Vacancy.  Or at least that's what I told myself as I was trying to come up with a reason to keep reading.  Certainly, I thought, it had to get better.  But sadly, it did not.  The first impression I had of The Casual Vacancy was that it seemed to be a poor imitation of Mauve Binchey's classic style, a collection of different characters that eventually came together at the end of an intricate but interesting story.  Unfortunately, the difference between these two authors is that Ms. Binchey's characters were fascinating, fun to get to know (even if they were evil) and her stories were often punctuated with a dry and unexpected sense of humor.  Totally delightful.  The characters in The Casual Vacancy were never really described in depth, possibly because by page 112 there were already 27 main characters.  I spent so much time flipping back and forth trying to remember who everyone was, who they were related to, and what their emotional handicap was, that I finally created a cheat-sheet of names.  However, by that point, I realized I had already lost interest in the entire book.  If you're a fast reader and can get through this novel fairly quickly I say go for it, if for no other reason than to see what Ms. Rowling has created.  But I highly recommend that as you start reading, you stick a post-it at the front of the book and jot down a brief description of each character as they are introduced, or feel free to print off a copy of what I typed up for my daughter, which I added as a hidden document entitled ""Roadmap"" on my webpage.  I pray that Ms. Rowling's feelings aren't hurt by the reviews this book has received, she is so obviously a kind and sensitive person, and so incredibly gifted.  And I truly hope she publishes another adult novel because I still adore her as a writer and a storyteller and would be the first in line to buy a copy.",2.0

Along the second intermission I asked myself why I was  paying good money to see people be mean to each other. The same thought occurred toward the end of The Casual Vacancy, although the price was a lot lower. It did seem as if there was a lot of nastiness between the book's characters. But, all in all, that excess only caused me to deduct one star, because the writing is excellent and the characters certainly colorful, if not always endearing. I realized that I had been caught up in the life of Pagford, the English village where the action is centered. I can't say that it is a microcosm for our world, but two things have reminded me lately of the need for us to be nicer to others: Virginia Woolf and Krystal Weedon.",4.0

Even so, there were too many characters and none of them are very likable. The book addresses an overwhelming amount of society's ills. In the village of Pagford, everyone is unbelievably messed up. There isn't one person who doesn't have a significant emotional or relationship problem. It was interesting to watch the characters unfold and to discover their secrets. There is a complex web of cause and effect, often created by the characters' misunderstandings of certain situations. I was compelled to keep reading, waiting for the inevitable train wreck. The book contains frequent use of the ""f"" word and some uncomfortably adult situations. It is an irreverent, sad, shocking, and at times, darkly humorous story.

The descriptions, the characters, the plotting, the suspense was great fun. There was nothing of the sort in a Casual Vacancy. I had assumed that JK Rowling, who I greatly respect would write a murder mystery, or an adventure. It never occurred to me that she would write a novel with almost no plot, no adventure, no action, just as a study of a number of people, none of whom I cared about, all of whom were uniformly awful and involve them in a really boring effort to run for a boring office. A number of the characters died or had a misadenture and I didn't feel the least bit sad as they were all uniformly non sympathetic.

Rowling apparently took care to make all her characters (including a tragic three-year-old boy and a number of unhappy teenagers) unsympathetic and obnoxious, and in this, she succeeded.

Yet, even in his most suburban novels, the characters were unique, the environment was suffused with a kind of underlying tension, and the stories were emotional adventures. This is never the case with this new book. The most touching character is Krystal, the welfare-class teenager who contends with a stupefied mother, a filthy environment, and a little brother who is infected from negligence. The other characters, (including the off-page Barry Fairweather who [spoiler] dies in the introduction) are mostly noticeable for their being annoying and narcissistic. The entire plot revolves around Fairweather's apparent charisma which is spoken about but never illustrated.

Unfortunately, my expectations were not met.  What a depressing book!  I can think of no reason to recommend this book to other readers, unless they are just curious about the author's ability to write an interesting novel for adults.  I'm sure that the author has the ability to do so, but I didn't feel it was demonstrated in this first attempt.  Please try again!",1.0
2012-10-23,R3CNJY91B0SCYR,lbjafwife,Offensive language alert!  Very disappointed!,"A huge HP fan, I was expecting great things.  Instead, I was vastly disappointed!  First, as she is introducing us to her cast of characters in the first few pages, I found myself thinking that none of these people seemed likeable or even interesting.  Most seemed to lead sad, pathetic lives.  Then, in 2 pages (p.13-14) she dropped the F-bomb 4 times, used s... twice and included other vulgar language.  I was shocked to say the least.  I decided to read on, hoping things would get better.  Instead, by page 21 we are treated to a teenage boy having an erection on the school bus as he watches his ""dream girl,"" which resulted in his needing to go home and masturbate for 30 minutes!  At this point, I stopped reading the book and returned it!  While I understand that this type of language and vulgarity is, unfortunately, prevalent in our society, I find it offensive and do not wish to hear or read it.  I am surprised that Rowling, with her writing skills and excellent command of the English language, could not find other words to describe these people and scenes.  Did she feel she needed to include obscenity and vulgarity in order to entice ""adults"" to read her book?  If so, what does that say about her perception of her target group?  Does she think that adults can't/won't read a book without it?  If so, she certainly didn't learn anything about the readers of the HP series!  I sincerely hope that she will revert to the writing style used in the HP series for future books and not insult us by thinking that she needs to lower her standards with obscenity and vulgarity.",1.0

2012-10-22,RI4PBP9JKLA2M,kcr,Characterization.. characterization.. characterization..,"First, I'm not all the way through ""The Casual Vacancy"" but I feel as though I can make a well-informed honest review at this point. Here's my advice: Do NOT go into this book expecting 1) A CHILDREN'S story; 2) Feel good, Dumbledore & Harry Save the Day stories; 3) Harry Potter. This is Rowlings first attempt at writing for ADULTS and she did a phenomenal job. Why did people love HP so much? The original storyline? No. We've all heard/read stories of good vs. evil our entire lives... no originality there.. It was her characterization and the connections she made within those characters. It's the familiarity of those characters that made you fall in love. Every single book-nerdy girl felt like Hermione at times or awkward boy felt like Neville... we related to the characters, not the story. And ""Vacancy"" does not fail in that aspect. Am I loving the storyline? Not entirely, but I knew I wouldn't by reading the synopsis... it's just not my ""style"" of story but she's sucking me in anyway. She makes me love and hate those characters because I KNOW them.. they exist in my neighborhood, just like they exist in yours. She really brings the story to life IF you can put down your magic wand and use your grown-up brain. And yes, she uses the big four letter ""c"" word most famously used in ""Atonement"". Get over it. It's an adult novel.. there's bound to be some language & I'm sure your teenage son as thought/said it at least once.",4.0
2012-10-22,R1OS0JW3T7GBIQ,Janine Rafferty,It's no Harry Potter.,"Having loved the Harry Potter series so much, I was somewhat disappointed in the book. For the first third of my reading, I'd pick up the book after a 2 or 3 day interval and have to figure out who all of the many, many characters were. By the end, the story pretty much came together, with many enjoyable parts, but I would not want to struggle with such a confusing cast of characters again.

Unfortunately, as talented as she is, she did not quite pull this off.  The premise of this books was very boring and the characters were dull and egocentric.  She spent far too much time developing the multipe characters in this book.  If this is the first book in a series, this could make sense, but again, I would not want to read it.  Perhaps I expected too much of her considering the magical world she created in Harry Potter.  However, I think she could have done much better with an adult book, even one not set in fantasy.",1.0

It was very well written and I totally bought into the town and the characters.  There was no fantasy in this book.  You could go into almost any town in the world and come away with these raw human emotions.  I liked how she reminded all of us that people are not always what them seem.  People turn out the way they are due to their youth circumstances and whether or not they are surrounded by loved ones or people who really care what happens to them in this world. It's also about how small minded people can be when their egos get in the way. I definitely suggest reading this novel.  I think that we all were ""curious"" of what Ms. Rowling would come up with after the huge success of Harry Porter, but I find it absolutely ridiculous that this book and the HP series be compared.  That would be like comparing apples and oranges.  Looking forward to her next book!",4.0

The Casual Vacancy is a well written novel populated by depressed, angry, trapped, betrayed and disappointed characters and it offers a startling glimpse into life in England that is rarely seen by starry-eyed anglophiles. The language is definitely ""adult"" as are the situations Rowling describes.  This book covers sexual abuse, petty crime, methadone clinics and all stops in between.

The writing itself was fine - nothing spectacular, but it was the story, the fabulous story, that drew us all in. I was very excited to read her first novel for adults. Sadly, I feel as if I am still waiting for it... and I've read The Casual Vacancy. It was obvious to me from about page 2 that I wasn't going to be thrilled by it. I quickly began to recognize sentence structures lifted straight out of HP, the language level felt 'dumbed down', and twists in the plot are dealt with in a very similar way as in HP. Admittedly I am an editor, but I wasn't looking for these things. I was actively trying NOT to see them because I loved HP so much... but they just leapt off the page and slapped me in the face.

She is descriptive and thoughtful when parsing her words, but I just didn't love this book. For me, The Casual Vacancy is a lackluster book that is for adults and plays to a very different audience. It deals with a ton of adult issues that are cringe worthy as it traverses life in a small english town and the often perverse characters who live there. It has profanity which is a good sign that this is for oldsters or the over 18 crowd.. This book suffers from a melodramatic and soapy plots that have a predictable endings.

2012-10-21,R19G6VVNQXEKV2,P. J.,Disappointing,"I'm a big fan of J. K. Rowling and looked forward to her first adult book: not sure I'll buy another. I wasn't engaged at all until well past the first third of the book and even then I had no trouble at all putting it down. Because I didn't get caught up in the story I had trouble keeping the characters straight and this was extremely irritating. I finished the book only because it was J. K. Rowling and I thought maybe it would straighten out. It didn't.  Originally from the UK I understood the words that were uniquely British so I don't know what difference that made to readers who didn't know their meaning. I suppose because I read all the Harry Potter books that I expected a page turner with lots of action and vivid characters. This book has a small plot - a man dies leaving an empty seat on the town council that must be filled, and tells a slice of the lives of the people involved. There is no, or very slow, advancement of the ""plot"" and no action to speak of, although Rowling employs subjects that involve children, a cause near and dear to her heart I understand, including the dark issues of self-mutilation, rape, poverty, addiction, abuse, etc. These are all awful things that need to be addressed but I'm not sure this is the proper venue, certainly not for me, or perhaps not in the way they were presented. A more intense and suspenseful story might have worked. I struggled hard to read this book in its entirety but perhaps that is because this is not the type of book I usually read. If Rowling's future adult books run along the same vein, then she will have lost me as a reader. I don't want causes in a novel I read for entertainment.

Similar to Binchy and Pilcher, Rowling uses a small village as a backdrop and bases her novel on the relationships woven among its inhabitants.  However, Rowling seems to infuse more colour, depth and realism into her characters. Some are crude but so are many in real life.  Harry Potter was a brilliant children/youth series but to try and compare this to that is a most unfair comparison.  This should stand alone and be judged on its own merits.",5.0

There were times while reading that I wanted to never read another word of it because of the cursing and raw descriptions of peoples actions. It made me uncomfortable.

With the Harry Potter novels being geared towards children and teens, it was amazing the depth and breadth JK Rowling maintained through each book and all subsequent books tied up wonderfully to the very end. I am an adult in my 60's, and anticipated her ""adult"" novel to have the same depth and even further enhancement of a powerful story line. The plot is boring and the story line drags along endlessly. I haven't ""invested"" any connection to the characters, not even enough to keep the names straight as to who is who. I bought it well over 2 months ago and yet been inspired to finish it. I won't give you a plot summary as you can read that on Amazon's review.

The situations, while probably true-to-life, were depressing and dark.  When I finished the book, I was in a royal 'funk' for a couple of days just thinking about it.

Every character and every scene is perfectly orchestrated to completion. Reading Casual Vacancy is like eating that perfect meal. It starts off with an explosion of flavor, akin to a beautifully prepared appetizer and from there Rowling guides the reader through a perfectly told story that is nicely sustained. A good story is one that the reader does not want to put down, but is not forced to rush through. It is a story that once over, its characters will be missed. And once completed, the storyline line and messages are still being contemplated in the minds of its readers. This is the brilliance of Casual Vacancy.",5.0

I thought it petered out somewhat and was expecting something a little more triumphant: reinforcing the social services, establishing child care facilities, dealing with the horrific housing problem.

Although the most likeable character dies in the first few pages, Rowling fleshes out the others realistically and skillfully over the course of this long but very readable novel. They are all flawed, vulnerable and very identifiable. Some are almost caricatures, but their stories all complement each other. As with Harry Potter, I couldn't put it down and I cried at the end.

It seems to me that Rowling's idea of good writing for adults is picking a fairly grim (but very factual) topic and then using really obscure words to describe it. Thank goodness for Kindle's definition function. The story didn't grip me and I didn't find any of the characters lovable enough to retain my interest.

But this time there was the deeper, darker, adult current that is behind the lives the children lived through in the earlier series.  JK has proven once more her immense capacity for character development and the complex inner workings of the desperately narcissistic psyches thriving in any community.  Having worked as both a community therapist and a school counselor in my own career, her descriptions of families and children at risk and those dealing with addictions were written so precisely as to feel like  real families on every street in every town.  The ego conflicts and complex weaving among the adults of her community also accurately reflect the human tendency to scapegoat the less fortunate and hide their sufferings from our own eyes because they too closely reflect our own hidden and feared pain.

Marble,The Casual Vacancy,"After plowing through the first 300 pages of this disappointing novel, I would say that J K Rowling should stick with young peoples' literature.  Adult literature to her is a lot of profanity in both American words and British words, teenage libidos running wild, and all the other evil deeds as listed by other reviewers.  There appears only to be hate, self-centered egos, and highly dysfunctional people.  There is no mystery, romance or even steamy sex scenes, the drama is even lacking...just raw emotions of getting even with those you have a distaste for whether it be parent, spouse, child or friend.  So many characters it is often hard to keep track of who is who.  The plot line is just who will fill a vacated councilman's seat and the ""fight"" to fill it.

The scenery slips by giving us a glimpse of rural beauty, counterpointed with images of despair, poverty, addiction, and petty politics portrayed by the sort of characters not created from dark magic, but the grittiness of contemporary life in rural England. There is little that is mystical in Casual Vacancy apart from the inner workings of teenage minds heavy with hormones on the voyage of discovery to adulthood.

It was extremely difficult to follow the characters who seemed quite two dimensional, difficult to maneuver much of the UK vernacular. I finally just put it down and shook my head.

It is not a fast-paced read, and it is not action-packed, but that's not what it's supposed to be.  It is a glimpse of a village in Britain which is small enough so that just about everyone knows just about everyone, or is connected in some way, and everyone gossips about everyone else, and everyone has an opinion (and feels superior to the opinions of others).

But the book was entertaining, and it struck at some serious points -- such as the ongoing  fight over how  the fortunate should deal with the downtrodden. The book spoke to the battle between those who want to help the poor, and those  who want to keep all their stuff and everybody else be damned.

The basic premise, exploring the characters in two adjacent towns as they fight to fill a vacant council seat, has some merit, probably, but I had trouble distinguishing the characters and caring about them.  Eventually I did end up caring about a couple of them and Rowling succeeds in making them believable, but the theme is disheartening and the outcome depressing.

Yes, the end-of-chapter cliffhangers are still there, and so is the dark psychology of the characters; but this is no children's novel. The power of this book comes from its multi-voiced storytelling, through which the reader accesses the inner worlds of a web of community members, all of whom are inexorably self-absorbed, fearful, and suffering. You will recognize yourself in all of these characters-- the adults and their teenaged children. This book makes your heart race, your stomach churn, and your mind question.

I really don't care what happens next, there is nothing compelling in the first 25% of the book that makes me want to keep reading.

But neither would there be this well-rounded, engaging, fine story. So the standard for me was: Would there have been just ""fine"" shrugs, or more, with another, less-famous writer? Was J.K.

There was a little bit of dark humor but also blatantly depressing points throughout the story, and it was all set against a slight political background which was interesting.

Her ability to weave so many stories yet keep the plot tight is also very good.

She tells with heartbreaking honesty about the lives of both adults and teenagers in a small English town (that could just as easily be in America).  At the heart of the tangle of lives is Krystal and Robbie Weedon and Barry Fairbrother's death was the beginning of the end for them too.  Husbands and wives, fathers and sons, all of their secrets are revealed and you just might recognize yourself in one of these oh-so-human characters.

Rowling's teenage characters exercise great hostility and disillusionment towards the adults closest to them as adult failings are literally advertised one by one.

Judged on its own merit independent of the HP series, this book is DARK. Rape, drug addition, seriously disturbed characters,viscous family relations, compulsion disorders around pedophilia, self inflicted cutting... this is not a light read. There are more messed up teens and parents in this small town than seems humanly possible. If that's the point that everyone is a hypocrite and has a hidden agenda, then she made that point well. That being said, the writing was sharp, the intertwined lives of the characters well conceived, the depiction of the town was vivid, but I found that I had to will myself to finish the book, mostly because there are really no sympathetic characters in the whole lot of them. You end up alternating between feelings of intense dislike mixed with pity for most of the characters and that fact kept me from really enjoying the book. I feel like I survived a 3 day ordeal just by finishing. My conclusion is that JK Rowling is a very perceptive writer with a sharp grasp of people's character flaws, but deep down I wished she'd touched upon some redeeming features of humanity. I felt like I needed a shower after finishing this book. Sure, she brings up many important social issues but you have to prepare yourself for a bleak few hundred pages.

The story sucked me in right away, and the way it all is pulled together in the end is amazing.

Both sad and entertaining, it is a social commentary on small town culture and the danger of taking oneself too seriously. Jo has that knack of familiarising you so well with a character in such a short span, that even if you cannot like them, you empathise. One cannot help but become involved, rather then just merely objectively viewing the story as a whole. I hope she keeps writing. I for one, am sold.",5.0

Rowling captures the ""real"" world - the world of liberals & conservatives, bullies & victims, rich & poor, old & young - in her first adult novel ""The Casual Vacancy"".  Her characters are fully realized, flawed members of the human race with all their capacity for love & kindness as well as mean-spirited stupidity.  Rowling has successfully created the same kind of magic here that she brought to ""Harry Potter"": she has invented fictional people who become real to the reader.  These are characters to love, to hate, and to mourn.  This is a place to live in and know - the way we know our own home town - and the way we know Hogwarts.  A fantastic achievement!

Retributions can be severe,"The things these English parents did do their children without even thinking about them finally caused the downfall of careers, and worse, a death of a young teen who was on the brink of being saved by the one person who cared about her and died an untimely death.  I think Rowling harbors a great deal of anger in her soul towards adults who are unkind, uncaring, and unfeeling towards their children.  This was evident in the Harry Potter series, but the young had recourse to magic.  In this book, the young have no recourse other than revenge by anonymous internet sabotage of the adults who have been monstrous or just plain stupid in their dealings with children and teens.  Personally, as I grew up, adults around me were so engrossed and occupied with their own problems, hang-ups and leftover hurts from their own childhoods, they were not able to see their own children objectively",4.0

The other reviewers have covered the plot - a small English town full of politics and dysfunctional families.  But what a plot Rowling can weave.  Some of it is so realistic as to be hard to take - particularly the bullying of teenagers (my least favorite part) but I quickly became engrossed in the characters and stayed up very late last night to find out what happened to them all.

I just finished it this morning, and I really would like to read more about the people of Pagford, as soon as possible. I was completely drawn into this very real and well written world, and if I have any disappointment, it's that the book was not longer, and that there isn't (yet) a sequel in the works. The characters were three dimensional, and interesting, and I have absolutely met many similar ""types"". Yes, there were a lot of characters, but this is a story about the inhabitants of a town - and to fill that larger picture, you need a big cast. I could see this novel translating easily to the small screen, perhaps over 5-6 episodes - I would love to see that in fact.

James's characters are seldom likeable, but James strives for truth-telling:  most people, in life as in her novels, are not pleasant people.  The same is true of Rowling's new novel:  telling the truth about one's characters is what Rowling's novel is about.  It's not sweet reading.  But it has the punch of truth:  the truth, as Rowling sees it, is not pretty.  If you want pretty and nice, stick to her novels for children;  if you want to understand human nature, read The Casual Vacancy.

I wasn't expecting wizards or magic or broomsticks or even humor. What I was expecting was a novel that wasn't super dull to read, and unfortunately  for me, that's exactly what ""The Casual Vacancy"" is, from start to finish: boring, boring, boring. And my goodness, how it DRAGS! Rowling's extremely vivid descriptions and characterizations were apparent in this book, but the problem is that all of the characters are basically selfish and one-dimensional, not to mention completely uninteresting.

Yes.  Is it a well constructed, deep piece of literature? Yes.  It is human emotion and raw need at its worst.  And it is very much like her Harry Potter books. They are dark and disturbing not light, sunny books either.  J K Rowling makes you feel strong emotions with her writing. She makes you think.  You need to look behind the story to see the real story she is telling. I had to come back and add to this review after continuing to read so many negative reviews. First- if you have not bothered to read the entire book please don't write a review - its not fair to the author. Second, if you bought this expecting Harry Potter that was your mistake not the author's. This book is clearly advertised as an adult fiction book.

I only read 17% of the book (on my kindle) and then quit reading it altogether because I couldn't stand another deplorable word.

I can't imagine anyone who has been a teen or a parent or who lives in a community -- in other words anybody -- being put off by this book the way some of the critics were. I'm astonished that any book review editor would have accepted a submission that started with and sometimes continued on the premise that this was no Harry Potter. That's not what you would call news or insightful. What was interesting and worthy of mentioning was her ability to create similar characters in vastly dissimilar situations. Harry and friends always felt like real teens with real teen troubles and desires even if their world was unreal. These teens and adults are real in the real world. It was not a perfect book.

By contrast, The Casual Vacancy is a regular novel, with a reasonably interesting but not extraordinary plot.

I can even understand why someone without a lot of time to read could put it down and forget to put it back up, but when it gets going this is a cracking domestic melodrama that will have you grabbing a few pages whenever you can.  I was also pleasantly surprised that it's much less preachy than I've been led to believe, I suspect J. K. Rowling and I don't see eye to eye on matters of social security and public housing, but not once does this book veer into progaganda, and if it didn't change my opinion about anything, it also didn't make me feel angry or even particularly challenged.

I think JK Rowling has written a perfectly fine book for adults and has proven she knows what she's doing, despite all the readers out there wondering why there's no wizards and why it's not more fun. The Casual Vacancy explores the lives of realistic characters in a confusing and often tragic realistic world.

I was very excited when I downloaded my copy to my Kindle and sat down to enjoy her work. The book is a sort of parable, as JK is fond of developing stories that operate on several levels.  At its most simplistic level, its about the death of a town council member and the ripple effects that death has on the members of his small community.  On another level it is a study of the politics and infighting of small town governance.  On yet another level, its a closer look at the inner workings of relationships rife with physical and emotional abuse, and the co-dependency that fuels these dysfunctional families.  And ultimately, it is a concrete demonstration of the evil that occurs when the village has no interest in helping to raise its neglected children.  Is it a happy story?  Not really.  Is it an interesting character study?  Absolutely.  You come to understand and sympathize with the members of JK's community, some of them against your better judgement.

Overall, the vacancy in this ponderous and pretentious book is anything but casual and confirms the suspicions of many, if many other reviews are an indication of public opinion: a lackluster book from a less than mediocre ""author""- there are better books in the world, and I hope that readers will continue to appreciate substance over tripe and hype.",1.0

Entertaining yet not superficial.  Yes, the book actually touches on real life, even some of the aspects of real life that are not pretty.

Or maybe more of Sukhvinder too, her plot and ending felt very much like that of a character like Neville Longbottom, just most entrenched in the Muggle world, obviously. But there were so many storylines that just felt like, ""well, this stuff happens in the real world."" Yes, it does, and the descriptions are probably quite accurate.

Each has a pronounced problem and you are shown why, they are so well written that I found that I wanted to slap some of them and put my arms around others. The book will hold you and make you think long after about the characters. In a way it seems to be a mirror, you must have the fortitude for self examination and the willingness to see the truth. She lays bare the most base attitudes and behaviors, it is subtle in some and extreme in others and you are made aware of just how much damage can come of it. There are chain reactions through out the book and there is a very tangible sense of how fragile life really is.

I purchased this book because I was curious about what type of story Ms. Rowling would write for an adult audience and was intrigued by the descriptions I read. I was hoping for a sharp, funny and insightful look at small town politics with its' real-life consequences. Instead, it was immediately evident that this story was another dark and morose tale of children being victimized by  cruel and dangerous adults, and in turn, victimizing each other. Ms. Rowling is adept at painting an exacting picture of the effects of cyclic poverty, substance abuse and child abuse that is apparrently as dire in the UK as it is in the US. She is also dead on at illustrating the chiasmic flaws in an ineffective and impotent child welfare system that is also apparrently as dysfunctional there as it is here. The last two chapters of the book were  the best, in my opinion. It left me crying, as a tragic ending will often do.

The story is firmly set in England, yet the plight of each person surely has a worldwide counterpart. The citizens of Pagford and Yarvil seem incapable of honest self-reflection.

I found it depressing, and the heavy voiced narration of  Tom Hollander in the Audio CD version didn't help.  Everything was tinged with a dark undertone; there seemed to be no hope in sight for any of the characters.  I found I did not like any of the characters enough to care what ultimately happened to them, and I am even seriously reconsidering my desire to retire to just such a small place as Pagford, some idyllic place in the countryside of the U.K. now seeming to be a horrible grouping of nasty minded, petty individuals I'd do well to avoid.",3.0

Trouble is, it doesn't appeal to adults, either. Certainly not to this one. The Harry Potter books started out fun and they grew progressively darker and less amusing. Even so, they were good reads.  Maybe that dark side managed to completely take over this author to the point where all entertainment was, unfortunately, blotted out. I had high hopes for something  immensely  readable here.

Thus, my expectations were high for the author's move to adult characters.  I purchased the book at the Philadelphia Airport before flying to a rural destination for four days knowing I would have much time with little or nothing to do.  My first criticism is that she introduces way too many characters in the first few pages and we are supposed to keep these people--parents and their children--separated one from the other.  To complicate this process, she alternates from using their given names and their nicknames.  Unlike War and Peace, there is no list to help the reader remember who the characters are.  I had nothing else to read otherwise I probably would have given up after 50+ pages.  All of the characters keep returning over and over so one does not feel that some are important and some not.

Rowling herself describes this book as a Black Comedy but there is one thing missing, there is not one thing funny in this book or even slightly amusing. With great anticipation the book finally arrived in the mail and I opened it ready for an evening of good reading. It has been a week now and I have only managed to get to page 56 and am calling it quits. In all fairness I did pick out random pages throughout the book and read them only to find out that it felt like what I had read in the first 56 pages. The characters, like the book itself, are flat and uninteresting, the cussing and the sex seems like she is trying to say See I can write for adults, except you don't have to be vulgar and crass to make a book good. Maybe if Barry Fairbrother had lived the book would have been better. Rowling also said that she didn't write the book for her fans but more for herself....maybe she should have had bound just one and kept it on her bookshelf and saved us all from wasting our money. If she writes another book will I buy it? Maybe after I have read more reviews and not just because she wrote it expecting it to be great. If I could ask her one question it would be will you please refund me my money so that I can buy a good book.

There is simply no reason to stuff every political-social-economic topic available into 500 pages of print.  The characters were polarized, not dynamic the way most people really are (ex. Snape), with their good and bad qualities. Many reviewers may object, but I feel like JKR does have somewhat of an obligation to consider the audience that brought her so much success.  Those who say she should be allowed to just follow her ""creative muse"" are those who like it.  Also what about the HP readers transitioning into adulthood who pick up this book?  It is being sold by the cash registers in my local BJ's!!  There should be a sticker on the cover indicating strong adult themes.  In addition no excerpts were offered of the book so that the reader could get an idea of what they were getting into.  Many authors offer that prior to the book being released.  All-in-all, I felt duped. And yes, I object to the Kindle price - probably determined by her publisher (I am not sure).  It seems somewhat disingenuous for a women who gained her early success while on welfare, to now be charging an arm and a leg for a book, much more than most authors, for a book with controversial content.

2012-10-07,R1WJ3WRE93VMU0,T. Foster,"Petty, selfish, unpleasant people and their disgusting behavior","This book is filled with petty, selfish, unpleasant people and their disgusting behavior. I'm an avid reader and certainly don't expect my novels to be nothing but sweetness and light, but this book is utterly unpleasant. It's a character-driven novel, but none of the characters are likeable or admirable in the least. This is not a story of good people fighting bad people; it's a story of disgusting, self-centered people interacting with other disgusting, self-centered people. The story jumps so rapidly from one character's POV to another's, I didn't feel invested in any of them; didn't know them; didn't care about them. I actually had to write notes to remember names -- who was whose son, wife, enemy, etc. There is very little plot; no causes or quests I cared about. It's filled with vulgarity in language, thought, and deed. I'd give it an NC-17 rating. I was ready to plow through the unpleasantness out of loyalty to Rowling, but realized around page 120 that, not only was I repulsed by these people, I was bored out of my mind. Rowling is a gifted writer, especially at describing people, personalities, and attitudes, but this novel is page after page of small, petty behaviors, not major actions that move the story forward. When one of the charcters started scratching his hairy navel, I decided I was done. I skipped and read the last two chapters, which were so depressing and pointless, I'm glad I didn't waste my time on the rest. So so so disappointing! Argh! Does Rowling really think the world is filled with nothing but vulgar, miserable people? I heard her describe this novel as a tragic comedy. Well, the comedy is very subtle indeed.",1.0

Yes, there are a lot of characters, but unless you work alone in your home, most of us touch the lives of countless others in our daily routines. And yes, many of the characters are unlikeable, but we all know unlikeable people, some of us ARE unlikeable people.  That said, after being introduced to the characters and how their lives were interwoven, it was very hard to put the book down.  (I am one who will read a few chapters, and if not engaged, will stop reading and move on to a new book.)

But Rowling is not content to depict middle-class adolescent rebellion. She goes even deeper, exploring a family from the Fields housing estate, whose daughter, Krystal Weedon, goes to school with Andrew and his unpleasant friend ""Fats"" Wall. Krystal barely has a family at all: a mother, Terri, who's a chronic heroin addict and former prostitute, a little brother who is learning disabled and neglected. One of the most powerful scenes in the book is when social worker Kay comes to interview Terri and tries to get through to her that her son is in danger of being taken away. Terri is barely there, a wispy wretch of a woman who can scarcely form a coherent thought. Yet Kay, enmeshed in her own personal problems, has this unexpected insight: ""But not to feel, not to care... Right now, Kay thought, she's happier than I am.""",4.0

So far, I am reading through a litany of character ""development"", but have not found one likable character.  Except for the reaction to the death of the council member, there doesn't seem to be a plot, and frankly, I wouldn't care what happens to any of these people if there were.

That was enough mystery to get me to download the free sample on my Kindle.  I was reading at a very good clip and knew I had to find out how this was going to end so  I bought it.  I was hooked and could not put it down in the beginning but somewhere in the middle it became mostly centered around teenage preoccupation along with an extreme overuse of crude language that was no longer necessary to build the characters.  Too many character dysfunctions made it more distracting than intriguing.  And so-called 'big secrets' I found laughable - not shocking.  It's almost as though the Author couldn't decide which of her good ideas she wanted to focus on so she threw everything in there and unfortunately, in my opinion, it became cluttered and lost its momentum.  It's a shame.  One of the questions in the interview was whether or not it would become a movie to which she said, no and now that statement makes sense. Bottom-Line:  I feel mislead.  I feel this was  written for teens in mind - not adults.  And I paid top dollar for a book that sadly, wouldn't be surprised to see in the discount book area by Christmas.",2.0

Same with Ms. Rowling's sorry sophomore slump in THE CASUAL VACANCY. I have to think her success with the Harry Potter series made her such an untouchable icon to her editor that no one felt powerful enough to tell her ""These characters really stink!"" JK Rowling's uber success with Harry Potter was her ability to craft people the reader not only cared about; they were adored, wept over, debated, imitated...ad nauseum. I read this mediocre novel just waiting for redemption but feeling through out the entire piece of indestinguished drivel that the author strove with every detached description to be OPPOSITE of what made her great.

2012-10-06,R3KSG0YTN015DS,Mrs. Marian,The Casual Vacancy,"J.K. Rowling's latest novel is a compelling story of the downfalls of class distinction, small-town pettiness, troubled marriages, angry and immoral teens, and the effects of abuse and poverty.  It is raw and painful; an insight into the struggles of people with no meaning in their lives beyond what is here and now.  J.K. Rowling is an amazing author, but I was so disappointed that her first 'adult' novel was so full of gratuitous smut.  Harry Potter went through life at Hogwarts never once having to relieve himself or take a bath, but in this novel we get descriptions of every sort of nastiness out there.  The main characters were supposed to be the adults, but Rowling's teens are the driving force in this novel, as well as the source of most of the vulgarity and disgusting behavior.  Why is it that today's authors seem to feel the need to add vulgarity and smut to their work in order to be read?  The Casual Vacancy covers nearly all of humanity's ills in lurid detail.  I can fully understand drug abuse, pornography, teen sexuality, child abuse, infidelity, and pedophilia without being dragged into the back bedroom to witness it. The last third of the book told the same story without all of the x-rated descriptions that were shockingly present in the early pages.  Though I appreciate the message and the reality of those who would overlook a small boy left alone, I won't allow my girls to read it, and my brand-new hardcover is going up for sale.

I am a huge fan so I grabbed this book via Kindle download as soon as it was available.  It's taken me nearly two weeks to finish it.

2012-10-06,R38VY4EF4PH6J3,R. Sherwood,I'll never see this in a high school library,"It's clear that J.K. Rowling is done with unfolding the shining wonder of the magical world.  She plunged also into the darkest depths of her magical world, and is in need of a change of pace from that as well.  The Casual Vacancy is her exploration of the banal and ordinary, the flat concrete grey in contrast to the brilliant chiaroscuro of the light and dark of her Harry Potter books.  There is no hero, no villain, in this book, but rather a small town full of characters of varying importance and qualities.  Their concerns could not be any more petty and unimportant to the greater world.  Everyone hates each other in The Casual Vacancy, and the most positive reaction I felt about any character was pity.  The rest of them I despised more and more as events progressed.  They all enjoyed each other's suffering, and I could hardly care, either, and yet Rowling still managed to make me cry at the end.",5.0

I found the book realistic, dark in places, character driven - hard to put down and also fascinating. Yes this is an adult book - and JK Rowling explored some intense issues sometimes graphically - yet she also explored some dark places in the Harry Potter series (which I also have read). The main characters are fully developed and multi faceted. I was never bored. I recommend Casual Vacancy for someone who wants to immerse themselves in a story and is willing to read about realistic, human foibles.

I found all the characters not necessarily likable but for the most part they felt real. There seemed to be a bit of poetic justice in the end when Howard has a heart attack and ends up being in the hospital for a long time.  The ending left me hanging a bit and I wish that it had continued on a bit more and not ended on such a sad note. I kept hoping that Barry Fairbrother would end up not being dead and would pop up at the council meeting when they voted on the Fields and Bellchapel. I thoroughly enjoyed the book the writing was excellent and the entire book was very descriptive. I found a few typos in the book mainly parentheses that shouldn't have been there. I was amazed, however, at the number of one star reviews from people who hadn't even read the book and were only complaining about the price. If you don't like the price don't buy it, but don't give it a one star review when you haven't even read it.

That way there wouldn't be so many whiners complaining about how ""I loved Harry Potter but this was just not my style"" and gave the book 1 star. It's unfortunate when an author can't write in a different style without the masses exclaiming she should have just left it at Harry Potter. If you can't stretch beyond your tiny box of what type of books you read, or you can't overlook that the ""Queen of Harry Potter"" wrote this novel, or you don't like contemporary novels, or you don't like anything that makes you uncomfortable-with-ugly-topics, perhaps you should save your trouble and not buy the book and then leave a horrible, undeserving review.",5.0

Why would her management and team of people around her allow her to put out something that wasn't an immediate success?  After 25 or so pages in, I thought, ""Ok, this is Rowling, the story telling is great, but man, this book is NOT good.""

Do not read this book to be uplifted. It is stark reality, and she captures the small town microcosm as well as she captured adolescence in HP. There were really only two characters in the book that I didn't like, and the book is full of characters and how their lives interweave. Most, however, were shown to be human - with all the hearts and warts attached. She not only writes about our prejudices, but she writes about how tragic events can turn lives around, can heal relationships, and can break people apart.

This is not a romance novel..... it is about individuals' shortcomings, misunderstanding of intent and subsequent fall-outs.  The frailty of the human spirit, the pettiness, fears, cruelty of the human psyche and how all of these affect people's lives.  Ms. Rowling's writing skill is so remarkable.  She has taken a group of characters and their lives and placed them into a clear order and class structure within the confines of a small town in England.

The characters are completely fleshed out, the language is strong but true, and the setting is so close to reality, as realistic as HP was fantastical.  I am reading The Goblet of Fire with my son, and to switch between the two books was interesting to say the least.  I am very pleased to have read this book and look forward to reading whatever else JKR decides to publish.",5.0
2012-10-03,REW8L9GUZ7W2M,DB,"Bold Call For Help For The Kids Who Are ""Have Nots""","I think the author could have rested on her laurels after her unprecedented success with Harry Potter.  However, instead my take is she felt called to action to point out this problem of the ""haves"" and ""have nots"".  For more than half way through the book I was thinking it was mediocre at best.  But by the time I finished it, I came to realize it was a bold, brilliant way to get us to think about the ""haves"" and ""have nots"" and how inside people's minds, daily thoughts and hearts they are all the same no matter which side of the tracks they live on.  Granted all of the people in this book were messed up, alhough Krystal and Kay did try to help others.  My guess is since the author has achieved unprecedented success, she has met people in high positions she would not have otherwise met and she has been unimpressed or even disappointed.  I think Rowling's bottom line is there are ""have not"" kids out there dealing with real problems such as drug addict parents and some of the people who appear to the be pillars of their towns, schools, etc. are not helping them because they fill their days with all of the nonsense/shortcomings we saw in the book.  Yes, I bet the next book will deal with more social issues.  And yes she will probably offend some people again as she attempts to influence them to action.  I think it is her way of giving back after all of her success.",5.0

The plot lumbers along at a moderate pace, introducing characters of the town of Pagford and outlining their situations.  While Rowling excels at character development, the townsfolk in this novel are unsavory, bordering on detestable.  Junkies, wife beaters, ambitious small-town politicians, despondent wives, and horny teenagers make up this cast.  Once everyone's intrigues are presented, the pacing slows down for the latter two-thirds of the book until the last 40-ish pages.  There's a mildly tragic and somewhat climactic conclusion, but by the end, I just wanted to be finished.

2012-10-03,R1VUNSLR4S30OX,JMK,"I loved it, and don't understand what people were expecting.","If more people had approached this book with an open mind, I think it would have gotten better reviews. Despite being told again and again that this book would be nothing like the H.P. books, some people obviously expected something similar. I also think if you understand something about the British sensibility you will like it better too. I've read lots of British authors works and if I had to compare her work to someone else's, I would compare it a bit to Faye Weldon's body of work. In my humble opinion, there is a greater divide between the ""haves"" and the ""have-nots"" in England. Rowling (and Weldon) love skewering the upper classes high opinion of themselves. In The Casual Vacancy, the little town of Pagford wants to cut financial support for a drug clinic in the Fields, which lies between Pagford and Yarvil. Pagford fancies itself the quintessential quaint English village, they don't want the taint of the Fields associated with their town. Of course the fact that a lot of the people in Pagford have roots in the Fields is something they'd all rather forget. Rather than realizing how lucky they were to escape the fate of most Fieldians and trying to help others improve their lot, they want to distance themselves from the people and problems of the Fields. It illustrates how quickly some people can forget where they came from once they get a little money. The biggest exception is Barry Fairbrother, who is from the fields, but lives in Pagford and serves on the town council and is trying to help one girl in particular, Krystal Weedon. Krystal is a perfect example of someone whose life could have gone either way. You get the feeling that if Barry had not passed away, Krystal may have had a chance. You see how easily someone can give up on themselves if no one else believes in them. I don't want to give anything else away but I think her characterizations are just a tiny bit caricatured but otherwise they seem pretty spot on. I hope Rowling writes many more books for adults and I hope she is not influenced by bad reviews to write fluff just to please people who'd rather not have a glimpse at a side of life they'd rather not know exists.",5.0

Although I didn't find it boring, I felt as though the first third of the book or so contained so many new characters written from so many different points of view that I felt like the first third of the book was more an introduction than anything, and it was a bit hard at first to keep all the names straight and remember who was who.

There wasn't a story, just one chapter after another describing one of the many pathetic characters who was ""flawed"" in one way or another.  It just became a chore to even open the book.  I hear enough of this kind of thing on the news.  Do I really need to read about it in a fictional book too?  I was hoping for a book that drew me into its world and I would want to find out more because I was concerned about each character.  This book was the polar opposite.

It was boring and I felt like the author was trying to be too edgy. It drags on and nothing really happens other than some really boring government issue.

Oh, yes, it is also about local politics and about responsibility for the outcast and addicted. There are many characters, few of them at all appealing, but vivid just the same.

Rowling does a thoughtful job of examining a small groups of people and the enmeshments that snarl their lives.  The events following the death of a counsel man, and the efforts of these people to deal with his absence, set the novel a task of explicating how these people come together.  I think a good job was done in exploring the difference between the public persona and the actual thought and circumstances of each character,  I especially like Krystal, the bad girl, whose genuine love for her brother goes largely unknown, as she becomes vilified as both ""a duty and a pleasure"" except by those who came to know her.

But I probably won't be reading this one over and over. It had so many characters, all unlikable, that it took a long time to get into it.  Many of my favorite books have a setting or characters I'd like to revisit.  I didn't find the ""darkly comic"" element of this book funny enough to compensate for the fact of nearly all the characters being desperate, whiny, involved in sordid behavior and endlessly thwarted.  I kept wondering what was the author's point in writing this book, since it couldn't be to tell an enjoyable story.  And the horrible details of poverty, drug addiction and various kinds of abuse are all too familiar to anybody who reads the news.  In the last 10% of the book the plot finally started to move along, and some of the characters at the end did get to grow and change.  **SPOILER ALERT**--when certain characters died tragically I was actually relieved, as they had no future and were doomed from the start by the circumstances of their lives (and also the circumstances of the book--it was hard to see how they could sink much lower and this wasn't the type of book where they were going to get a happy ending).  One of these characters was the most sympathetic in the book and only in the last few pages were some anecdotes revealed that added to her humanity.  By the end I thought the author's point was probably to draw attention to the ways in which society fails its most disadvantaged children, and that in an interdependent world this has repercussions for people from other socioeconomic levels.  She accomplished this pretty well but it wasn't new territory, and not the book I was hoping for.",3.0

If this book was not written by JK Rowling, it probably would not have been published, which is a real shame. Its an important story about something that is effecting most communities due to the bad economy and harsh austerity measure. The town of Pagford is a wealthy one and when Barry Fairbrother, a do-gooder on the local council dies, a fraction of people want to get rid of the poor district of Fields and the methadone clinic. Like what is happening in the UK and the US and all over, some people would rather let the little guy fend for himself rather than work together as a community to help out everyone.

There's the self-satisfied and self-important parish council chairman whose chief goal in life is to cut off from his village a local housing project and de-fund the social services that help its struggling residents.  There's the middle-aged woman, trapped in a loveless, boring marriage, who secretly obsesses over a member of a boy band she sees in her daughter's DVD collection.  There's the middle manager at a printing company who terrorizes his wife and kids as though they were inmates in a concentration camp of which he is the commandant.

2012-10-01,R1MDW2ZIYIG9QO,F. M. Pepoon,Lack of Character Development Is the Fatal Flaw,"I am a big fan of the Harry Potter series and have read the books again and again, wondering at JK Rowling's ability to create a world so real and appealing that readers want to live there, and to create stories that are so compelling they become a part of a reader. Sadly, this book did not come close to either of those experiences. As any Harry Potter reader knows, character development is not one of Rowling's strengths, and this is the fatal flaw of the book. The teenage characters are more finely wrought than the adults (as was true for the Harry Potter series) and there are a few of these teenagers who are engaging. I wish Rowling had either focused on the teenagers' stories more or developed the adult characters. The plot is mildly interesting and kept me reading through 2/3 of the book, but at that point, the fact that I did not care enough about the characters to continue reading overcame any vested interest I had in the story line. Finishing the book was a chore, and I found the ending to be wholly unsatisfactory. I hate when authors kill off characters because they cannot figure out what should happen next, it is an insult to the readers. If Rowling had spent some time developing some of the adult characters - there are two women in particular who could have carried the book - this might have been more successful. Alternately, instead of starting the book with the death of a man who appeared throughout the tale to be one of the few with any morals, Rowling could have started with his story and had him die later, which would have created an interesting pivotal point in the plot and tension in the story.",2.0

2012-10-01,RR9K50RTJ6TV7,Pen Name,Very different from what you've come to know and expect from Rowling.,"I have to start out by saying what a huge fan I am of J.K. Rowling, because I feel that may help some people understand my review better.  I'm a HUGE Potter fan, I re-read the series regularly and have been anticipating the release of any new book by Rowling for the past 5 years.  That being said, I didn't expect this book to be anything like Harry Potter plot-wise, or even in theme.  I was super-excited about something completely new from J.K. Rowling.  Regardless of what anyone says of her prose in her previous series I always found something sparkling and intoxicating in her writing style and characterizations.  So I eagerly purchased the Casual Vacancy on the first day of its release, and launched into it like a child greedily rips open presents on Christmas morning.  If anything asserts the distinction that this is not Harry Potter or any other book for young readers its the immediate and excessive usage of loose profanity, rampant drug and alcohol abuse and sexual depravity.  We are launched into the mind of every single character we encounter at some point, viewpoints shifting back and forth dizzyingly.  This allows us a unique access to their thoughts and backstories, and this third-person omniscent is very contrary to the third-person limited we experienced in her series.  Being a lover of minute details and normative everyday activities and thoughts, I was prepared to love this in every way.  You have to understand how much it pains me to say that I don't think I do, I feel the need to love it, to defend Jo Rowling and all her brilliance, but I think it would be ""inauthentic"" of me to claim it.  To me it feels like there's something missing.  This book is so dark and gloomy and heavy, and perhaps its meant to be after years of writing good-natured comedy and happy endings.  However the heaviness is wearing, and I found myself returning relentlessly back to the book, not as I have to all her others in avid anticipation of what would happen next, but with a sense of duty.  Though the characters are not wholly uninteresting, there're all seriously flawed in one way or another (which may be more true to life) but which makes it difficult to really find any of them likable and sympathetic, though it gets easier towards the end.  Something I missed here too was Jo Rowling's talent to easily weave seemingly small, but vastly important details into the story and keep them hidden there for later discovery and impact.  She does much less vivid a job creating a physical world for us under the assumption we can just see the small town without fresh and fruitful descriptors, and as a result the town seems flat, the homes nearly indistinguishable.  For me, the spark was missing, and throughout at least 90% of the novel I could scarcely believe it was authored by J.K. Rowling.  And though I'm sure she's intentionally moving away from and editting her writing so it doesn't match Potter, the attempt to redefine seems to rob some of the best qualities of Jo Rowling's writing.  Overall, it's okay, not completely unenjoyable, has some really poignant and heartfelt moments, but definitely isn't for everyone and won't inspire the cult following of her previous series; which may have been Jo's intentions all along.",3.0

It was not long before the characters' lives exposed themselves for what they were or for what they were to become, humour being overtaken by the stark reality of gloom and doom. This was to be the focus of the much larger part of the book and  made the book as a whole seem out of balance. The endless, sordid and squalid misery in the lives of the over-ample sufficiency of characters presented me with nothing beyond my awareness of life for some people.

2012-09-30,R1J81POZYAE4UL,Jo D.,A great novel for grown-ups.,"So this is what real life is like after 'Dumbledore' dies -- or in this case, the excellent and upright councilman, Barry F. Without his empathy and intervention, everything goes from bad to worse in Pagford in this very grown-up novel from Rowling, who proves herself a very able writer indeed in this realistically depicted tragedy of modern-day politics and class antagonism. I found this book entirely engrossing, with well rounded characters with mostly believable obsessions and hang-ups [though for my taste Colin, or ""Cubby"", the deputy schoolmaster, was a little too Wing Biddlebaum for me to quite believe]. I was impressed that Rowling was so very in control here not just of her sentences [I only spotted one real clunker] but of her excellent imagery and tone. Her bleak view here is entirely intentional, as her last-minute leavening of an otherwise unremittingly tragic ending with a well told reminiscence shows us. And what is she trying to show? Well, when the little tike who fantasizes about the speed of real cars by saying, ""Broom! Broom!"" [in a quick nod to Harry's Nimbus 2000] meets such a sad final fate, Rowling is clearly letting us know that our magic-free world can only be improved incrementally and through the faltering efforts of rightminded individuals like the much missed Barry, so much do we depend on each other, despite all our flaws. Change is hard, so we need empathy to cut through our own vacancy and apathy and spur us to help, even when such help seems even less than pointless given the enormous weight of suffering on the one side and the forces of social injustice aligned to protect the status quo on the other.",5.0

The characters in this novel have nasty little secrets and the death which opens the story serves to reveal their many flaws. All of this makes Rowling appear more cynical and less humorous than in the Harry Potter series, and the book did start to feel very dreary about one third through. But I soldiered on, confident that the feeling of being in the hands of an excellent storyteller I had enjoyed during the opening pages would pay off. And it did. The resolution, while tragic, was satisfying and the changes that characters exhibited were believable and touching. I think her characters rang true and even though their lives were rather sordid, I didn't feel that the book itself was. It made for an engrossing, thought-provoking read. I would recommend it, but read the synopsis and don't expect anything magical other than Rowling's deft ability to expose a character's innermost secrets with precision and wit.",4.0

We have all the same people here, we have ""projects"" and ""welfare moms"" nearby in a slightly larger town. Her description of political maneuvering in elections in small towns is exceptionally honest as is her portraiture of adults who cannot control computer sites as well as the teenagers involved. (But then I worked with teachers who did not know how to turn on their own computers, but I digress.)Throwaway children die every day and no one helps them, because they are dirty and smell bad.

Her ambition is to create a portrait of the complexity of ordinary human life: quiet tragedies, petty character failings, small triumphs, and quiet moments of dignity. The complexity of her portrait of provincial society is reflected in the complexity of individual characters.

Truth is, it was more like Salinger or Vonnegut, harsh realism and depressing insight into human weaknesses. The book is gritty, dark, humorous, and too believable.

2012-09-29,R2M2T4B6D53XYL,A. Prentice,A Very British Novel; A True Heroine,"This is a novel in a very English tradition; it has echoes of Dickens, of George Meredith, of Evelyn Waugh. Post-World War II, it has notes of John Mortimer's Paradise Postponed and more than a few hints of Martin Amis. Rowling sets her nominally political tale about a local concil election in a setting that contains both the beauty of a traditional English village - Pagford - and the grit of an industrial city - Yarvil - inextricably linked, as the history of England includes the green and pleasant lands and the dark Satanic mills. She people both towns and tells the interwoven tales of many families, contrasting the middle class and the poor. What is unique about this book are the combined voices of the teenagers who inhabit it: Krystal, Andrew, Sukhvinder, Fats, and Gaia. These are young people struggling to survive and find a way to successful adulthood - some will make it and some won't. While Rowling can be somewhat humorous in portraying the imperfect adults in this novel, she is serious about the children and depicts them with knowledge, empathy. The most poignant character is the most desperate, Krystal Weedon, who came to remind me in many ways of Bill Sykes' Nancy. She is a true English heroine for modern times. The conversations of flawed parents and their desperate children are gripping and memorable. I cried at the end of this book and I'm not sure at all why reviewers are calling it a black comedy.  The images of Krystal and her young brother Robbie at the end of the book will stay with you for a long time. HIghly recommended.",5.0

There is no magic here to offer any hope of change, no wizard to sweep down and offer aid, either to the characters or to the reader, and as the action progresses, with its focus on the unpleasant and often violent aspects of many lives, the reader is forced to examine the elements of chance which can devastate everything that one might dream of.",3.0

First off, you need to set aside Harry Potter and read this book as if it were the only work of hers you've ever read.  If you go into this expecting Hogwarts and all the gang reinvented, you will be disappointed. You'll love or hate this book on the strength of her work, not because it is part of a mega-phenomenon. It is a story of ordinary people, living rather mundane lives. Their politics are mundane and too important to them; their motives are the usual trifling things which motivate petty people.

I finished reading this book about eight hours ago, and I find myself still haunted by it.  A gritty version of ""It's a Wonderful Life"" set on a street much like Privet Drive, it is a challenging book.  Yes, it is a tragedy, foreshadowed from the beginning, but elaborate plot twists are not the point.  The point is the characters.  You won't like them at first, and you are not meant to.  Rowling unveils the way in which we are all cabined off from compassion by our own self-centered dramas.  She takes you on a journey of your own failings, and it's a cruel and unfortunately accurate journey.  But then she surprises you with compassion, even for some of her most unlikeable characters, even for you.  For example, this sentence:  ""How awful it was ... the way tiny ghosts of your living children haunted your heart; they could never know, and would hate it if they did, how their growing was a constant bereavement.""  All she asks is that you have the compassion for others that she has shown for you.  You finish the book with a series of ""if onlys,"" because so many of the characters have the chance to avert tragedy, and fail.  If only, you can't help think, Hagrid was there, with his pink umbrella -ella -ella.  But this is the real world, and somebody like us has to rescue the boy under the stairs.  Rowling doesn't leave us without hope, however.  As in the original ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" you also finish the book with an indelible sense of what one imperfect person CAN do.",4.0

I realize this wasn't supposed to be Harry Potter and comparisons are moot, but I didn't expect it to be the diametric opposite of HP. It is written for a totally different audience, an audience that does not consist of me. This thing can go sit on bookshelves with the likes of John Grisham and other rich people cranking out meaningless dramas. Where Harry Potter created a beautiful, rich, diverse cast of characters, The Casual Vacancy creates the same caricatured people I read to avoid. I found myself liking the characterizations of the teenaged characters (with the exception of social worker, Kay), and would be interested in seeing Jo create a realistic young adult novel, or even a more political novel, rather than the upper class gossipfest this was. There was some compelling themes that could have been explored further (the clinic, ""the light of God shone from every soul"") but ultimately went unresolved. It also would have worked better, in my opinion, as a linear novel, rather than one told from too many points of view, leading to a crowded, overwhelming read.",1.0

What a disappointment it turned out to be!  Sure there were lots of characters but I didn't feel any sympathy toward them.  And the language!  No thanks, I don't need to read all that profanity and tasteless talk. Why couldn't this adult book be written for grown-ups?  Why is something considered ""adult"" because it is filled with tasteless profanity* just for the sake of it i.e. the F bomb ad nauseum?  We expect our children not to talk that way and read that stuff but as adults we accept it?

I see that almost everyone gained self knowledge (and most did not put it to any use); I see that hacked Facebook pages as a means of knowledge is very clever (JKR lives); I see that a girl who was being destroyed is more confident because she is imitating someone (Kristen) whom she does not really see as she is - but I didn't care.

2012-09-27,R2V01YT4S3LAPA,Amazon Customer,Updated after finishing: THIS BOOK COULD BE TRIGGERING FOR PEOPLE RECOVERING FROM BEING CUTTERS OR ABUSE,"Update: finished the book.  Not really my kind of fiction, I read fiction to STOP thinking about the depressing inequalities and unhappy endings in real life. (Slight spolier) I knew there was going to be a suicide in the book from reading reviews. I found myself wondering which character it would be (there are over 20 characters whom we get point of view from, maybe over 30) but not particularly caring too much. It was one of the top 5 I suspected, tho the triggering event was a bit of a surprise it was predictable many pages before the triggering event happened. Folks DO need to go in prepared, one thing I didn't see mentioned in reviews was that one of the characters is a cutter. This, plus the POV portrayals of spousal and child physical abuse and rape could be very triggering for some folks. Being inside the mind of a character while they are slicing up their arm with a razor blade if you are a recovering cutter (or other self-mutilation behavior) could be a very bad thing is my concern. I finished the book feeling like I had just sat through a really rough time with a friend who was just really awakening to the horrible disparities in society and hadn't really found their footing & hope for the future yet. It is not an optimistic book, and there weren't any characters I really connected with - none of them felt at any point like people I would really want to sit & have a cuppa with if I knew even as much about them as the other characters did. Might be a really good book for folks thinking of going into social work or community activism to read though. Depressingly accurate portrayl of that from my experience. I suspect a lot of this was JKR trying to process & come to terms with her own kids being teens/young adults in the socioeconomic situations she's been in, etc, and her trying to understand why some of these horrible things happen in the world where she doesn't see any humans as pure saints or pure evil.",4.0

2012-09-27,R24XIG1MUET24L,Martin Olvera,Way too expensive !!,I was very excited to buy this book for my Kindle Reader but...$17.99...are you kidding ? In this economy ??,1.0
2012-09-27,R1PT4K41BLDYIS,Computer Geek,Was excited to buy until I saw the price for ebook.  Boycotting,"After reading the news that this was released, I immediately went to Amazon to buy it.  At $17.99 for an e-book though, it simply isn't worth it, especially for a new, unproven series that isn't Harry Potter.  I will be waiting until the price falls or I can get it from the library as an ebook.  (Removed unhelpful comments about how much money JK needs)",1.0
2012-09-27,R197OEN8MC00BW,Amazon Customer,gave it a chance and actually READ it,"I purchased ""The Casual Vacancy"" last night on my Kindle Fire.  As a student, I don't have a lot of spare money for books and the price was slightly deterring, but I grew up with Harry Potter and absolutely love JK Rowling's writing, so I decided to go ahead and buy it. I have experienced no problems at all with the format of the book; the Kindle Fire offers 8 different font sizes, and I have been reading this book at the second smallest option.  So, price and Kindle format both were essentially non-issues for me.",5.0
2012-09-27,RPFT77F7JAYXL,Booksrfun,"You are truly inspiring!  Keep it up, J.K.!","The portrayal of the characters on this book is very deep and real and as original as if someone really lived through the situations, totally different from her previous published Harry Potter fantasy series.",4.0
2012-09-27,RNFMQUHBJ4V3K,Amazon Customer,Have not read and will not read,"Maybe I am not being fair but, based on the reviews that I have already read, the use of the ""f"" word and other profanity is not entertaining to me and I will not read a book that is laced with it.  If I start a book that ""sucked me in"" with it's description and find that the profanity is there, I dump it and go to another.  That's why I mostly get the free ones or ones for a few bucks.  I won't wast money on such things.  This author was so successful with the Harry Potter series without the bad language.  It saddens me that she would resort to using it just because she is writing for adults.  Doesn't say much for us older folks does it!!  Sooooooo, I am rating without reading this time.  Sorry if I offended anyone.  Not my intention.",1.0
2012-09-27,R3NYVQL5KSDW84,Holly Day,From Someone Who's Actually Read It!,"Just to set the record straight on Casual Vacancy, I was given a copy as a gift. When you read the book, you need to forget this is the same author who gave us Mr.Potter's world of magic. This is set in a tiny English town and deals with politics,class struggle,poverty,drug use,child abuse,rape,self-mutilation, suicide, pedophilia,mental illness and other ugly realities. Much to her credit the author does this with sharp comic wit, however it does all go on a bit too long with the ending being somewhat predictable and heavy-handed. It goes from being a lively comedy of manners to over-wrought slog by the end. I will say that I did enjoy her attempt to combine cutting comedy with social commentary. This is definitely not a book for the children in your house with the salty, profane language and delicate subject matters.",3.0
2012-09-27,RPASH7402XTWF,Saguaro View 124,So far so good!,"I've only gotten about halfway through the book, but I can honestly say that I've been enjoying it. The characters are beautifully realistic. I think that as someone who grew up reading Harry Potter it is very nice to see J.K Rowling writing again. So far I have loved this new different novel, but it makes me honestly upset to be critiquing it for its format and it's price. And I at least read a story for the story itself and not for its looks.",5.0
2012-09-27,R1CPR2VULBSWDJ,Kindle Customer,"Everyone can see the price, Idiots!","I can see the price for myself when looking at purchasing the kindle edition so I don't need 20+ people telling me that it's too expensive! There was only one review of this book out of MANY that was actually about the content of the novel. I love JK Rowling and grew up with Harry Potter so I will buy this book and pay the $17.99 without a complaint. As Americans, we pay for convenience... that's what makes the economy go round people! If you don't like the price DON'T BUY IT! If you want to read it I'm sure you can wait until the price drops or it's available at the public library. The world has enough REAL victims without all of us thinking we are because of the price of a book... get a life!",5.0
2012-09-27,R13K3X5HTF388Q,Kindle Customer,Thanks for nothing,"Thanks a lot, folks. I looked at the reviews to see how other people had rated this book and why so I could decide whether or not to purchase it. What I found here were complaints about the e-book price and responses to those complaints. A book is a book, no matter the format. I own a Kindle but do not necessarily expect the books to be less expensive. My decision on what format to purchase is sometimes determined by the weight of the book but mostly by whether I have friends who would also like to read it. Get over yourselves and your complaints about price. Buy the book or don't buy the book. The rest of us don't really care and you are wasting our time.",5.0

2012-09-27,R9PRTXD1TBNQU,Amazon Customer,The Casual Vacancy of Harry Potter,"LOL! It was funny to see J.K. Rowling try to write a book that was not Harry Potter.  The title is misleading but there is more than a vacancy that's casual.  Some may call the title artistic and witty, but I think it's quite the opposite being that Harry Potter is not in the book which makes the vacancy more than casual.  I think the book should be titled ""The Enormous Vacancy.""",1.0

I must set my kindle font to the biggest it allows and it is still too small to read comfortably (plus the margins are now huge).

2012-09-27,R1ZPZ1DPCHVCXD,Letting Light In,What One Needs to Know About Kindle Price,"I'm confused by people who complain about kindle prices not being lower. For starters they do not understand the difficult economics of book publishing [printing costs are only a small part of cost--thus only a small difference in cost]. Buying a kindle or ebook reader for cost savings isn't a wise idea--unless you plan to just read public domain books. Used or secondary market physical copies usually cost less or if they aren't it will generally be for a popular book you can buy and easily resell. So while I understand there are good reasons to own a Kindle or Nook, just getting it for saving money seems to be missing the point.",5.0
2012-09-27,R2DR06MKOE9QJ4,rocka-chic,Don't buy it if you cant afford it,There is such a place called a library. You can check the book out and read it if you feel the price of the book is too high. People complain about the most absurd things. In the time it takes to type up a nasty review...most people would come to the conclusion to 1. go to the library or 2. wait a couple months for the price to go down. Work smarter not harder people!
